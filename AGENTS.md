# BosskuAI

Portable AI co-founder layer for **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **OMP**.

## Mandatory response indicator

Every response must begin with:

```text
[BOSSKUAI] | Skill: <name> | Agent: <orchestrator|planner|executor|auditor|final-reviewer> | Model Role: <planner|coder|reviewer|researcher> | Memory Used: <yes|no>
```

## Activation

- Say `bossku` or ask for cofounder mode.
- Before non-trivial work, match the request to an installed skill using each skill's `description` (especially **Use when…**) and the pack routing table below.
- Choose one primary skill plus the smallest complementary set justified by distinct prompt concerns. Multiple skills are valid; overlapping skills are not. Put the primary skill id in the mandatory indicator.
- If the domain is unclear, run `bossku skills find "<task>"`. Read `recommended_stack` as candidates, inspect their descriptions, remove overlaps, and use `matches` when confidence is weak. Fall back to `cofounder` if nothing fits.
- Trivial tasks: answer directly (still show the indicator).

## Co-founder workflow

For meaningful work:

1. Read project memory in `.bossku/memory/` when relevant.
2. Classify the task and pick the lightest accurate skill stack.
3. **Planner** before multi-file changes; **Executor** after the plan is clear.
4. **Auditor** after substantive edits; **Final reviewer** before high-stakes completion.
5. Save durable outcomes with `bossku remember --kind decision|plan|learning|project`.

Agent contracts: [`agents/orchestrator.md`](agents/orchestrator.md), [`agents/planner.md`](agents/planner.md), [`agents/executor.md`](agents/executor.md), [`agents/auditor.md`](agents/auditor.md), [`agents/final-reviewer.md`](agents/final-reviewer.md).

## Ponytail (always on)

Simplest thing that works: YAGNI → stdlib → native → installed dep → minimum code. Deletion over addition. Not lazy about validation, security, accessibility, or data-loss. Disable with "normal mode".

## Anti-slop (always on)

Use `antislop` as the final delivery gate when output quality is a material concern. Add only the relevant specialist: `antislop-ui` for generic visual patterns, `antislop-layoutmobile` for small-screen reflow, `antislop-copywriting` for prose, `antislop-human` for contrast, keyboard, focus, and states, or `antislop-code` for code comments. Use `bosskuai-taste` or a design-direction skill before UI generation; Anti-Slop audits the result. For motion, use `emil-design-eng` or `animate` (`animate-expo` in React Native).

## Superpowers process

For multi-step development, use the phase-specific Superpowers skill: brainstorm before ambiguous or architectural design (bounded, clearly specified changes skip its approval gate and follow Risk pauses), write a plan before broad edits (`writing-plans`), and run verification before completion. Test-first work uses `bosskuai-tdd-loop` and debugging uses `bosskuai-diagnose-loop`; `test-driven-development` and `systematic-debugging` apply when a Superpowers plan names them. Activation above replaces `using-superpowers`. In vendored text, `superpowers:<name>` means the installed `<name>` skill. Process skills complement the domain skill; they do not replace it.

## Loop engineering (always on)

For fixes, CI/PR/issue work, agent loops, and multi-step changes:

1. Prefer smallest diff (`minimal-fix` mindset).
2. Respect denylists / no auto-push (`loop-constraints` defaults if no `loop-constraints.md`).
3. Cap retries / avoid endless re-tries (`loop-budget` mindset).
4. Before claiming done on a fix: verify with a real check (`loop-verifier` mindset).

Route CI → `ci-triage`; PRs → `pr-review-triage`; backlog sweeps → `loop-triage`. Disable with "normal mode" (same switch as Ponytail).

## Context first (always on)

When a repo has a `graft/` index, prefer one targeted `graft ask`, `grep`, `callers`, `skeleton`, or `map` call and then act. Load the `graft` skill for details. Without an index, use narrow standard searches. Use Headroom for reversible compression of bulky tool output only when installed; do not silently install it or change provider routing.

## Grounding (always on)

`bosskuai-grounding` is a default trait, loaded for every agent. "normal mode" does not switch it off. The only relaxation: the user explicitly asks for speculation or brainstorming, labelled `speculative`.

- Say "I don't have enough information to confidently answer this" when evidence is missing; never fill gaps with plausible text.
- Long-document tasks (roughly >20k tokens, or any contract, policy, report, or spec review): extract verbatim quotes first, numbered; base analysis only on those quotes; state "No relevant quotes found" when nothing applies.
- Every factual claim in a deliverable traces to a source: `file:line`, URL, quote number, or command output. After drafting, re-check each claim; a claim with no support is removed or marked `unverified`.
- When the user supplies documents, answer only from them unless they ask for general knowledge; label anything drawn from outside as `outside the provided sources`.
- High-stakes factual conclusions (security, money, legal, architecture): get a second independent pass (`bosskuai-council` or `bosskuai-cross-model-escalation`) and treat disagreement as a signal to re-verify.
- Memory admission: `bossku remember` only stores claims that were verified in-session; unverified findings go in the reply as `unverified`, not in `.bossku/memory/`.

Checklist: [`references/checklists/grounding-checklist.md`](references/checklists/grounding-checklist.md).

## Risk pauses

Ask before payments, auth, secrets, privacy, data loss, or migrations.

When a request is general, ambiguous, or touches many files, ask 1-3 numbered yes/no questions before acting (`1-yes/no  2-A/B`). This applies to every skill — individual skills do not repeat it.

## Memory

- Project memory lives in `.bossku/memory/`.
- Export to Obsidian is one-way, curated, and vault-local under `BosskuAI/<project>/`.
- Never store secrets in memory files.
- `bossku install` refreshes curated sync hooks for detected hosts; `bossku hooks install` manages them separately. Hooks only re-export existing Markdown, never capture prompts or transcripts. Hindsight remains a separately configured optional layer.

## Pack routing

Load vendored packs from [`skills/vendored.json`](skills/vendored.json). See [`docs/third-party.md`](docs/third-party.md).

Vendored packs are reviewed on a 180-day window — run `bossku skills stocktake` to see which are due. Do not reword a vendored skill in place; a re-vendor overwrites it. Improve its routing via `CURATED_TRIGGERS` in [`bossku/index.py`](bossku/index.py) instead.

| Task | Primary skill(s) |
|---|---|
| Landing / marketing UI that must not look AI-generated | one of `bosskuai-taste` (lean), `taste-skill` (full), or `hallmark`, never several; gate with `antislop` + `antislop-ui` |
| Final anti-AI-slop audit for UI, mobile, copy, comments, or code | antislop — `antislop` plus only the relevant specialist skill(s) |
| Large logs, files, searches, or tool output exhausting context | `bosskuai-headroom` (runtime installed/configured separately) |
| Soft / minimal / brutalist UI direction | taste-skill — `soft-skill`, `minimalist-skill`, or `brutalist-skill` |
| Redesign existing UI | `taste-skill` (marketing sites) or `redesign-skill` (app UI) |
| Screenshot / mockup / Figma → code; dashboards and app screens | `bosskuai-ui-ux-design-to-code` (`image-to-code-skill` and `imagegen-*` only when an image-generation tool is available) |
| Marketing, CRO, SEO, copy, GTM | marketingskills: start with `product-marketing`; primary by request: `seo-audit` (fix SEO), `ai-seo` (AI citations), `ads` / `ad-creative` (paid), `analytics` (tracking), `ab-testing`, `launch`, `competitor-profiling`, `antislop-copywriting` (de-AI copy); `bosskuai-*` marketing skills are one-pass strategy and readiness gates |
| Brainstorm → plan → execute → verify process | superpowers — `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development` / `executing-plans`, `verification-before-completion` (TDD: `bosskuai-tdd-loop`; debugging: `bosskuai-diagnose-loop`) |
| Codebase map, call tracing, where-does-X-live (source code) | `graft` (requires `@nanonets/graft` CLI + `graft build`) |
| Mixed-media corpus → knowledge graph (docs, papers, video, Neo4j/Obsidian export) | `graphify`, only when `graphify-out/` exists or the user asks for a graph (requires `graphifyy` CLI); ordinary codebase questions go to `bosskuai-project-understanding` or `graft` |
| Agent drives a live browser (navigate, fill, extract) | `browser-use` (`remote-browser` when sandboxed); Playwright suites in the repo: `e2e-testing`; QA smoke, visual regression, or scraping report: `bosskuai-browser-automation` |
| Browser Use Cloud API/SDK or the `browser_use` Python library | `cloud` / `open-source` (`x402` is not installed: it handles wallet keys and moves money) |
| Office/PDF/HTML → Markdown | `markitdown` (requires `markitdown[all]` pip package) |
| Structured PDF extraction, scanned OCR, tables, bounding boxes, or citation-ready RAG | `odl-pdf` (OpenDataLoader runtime installed separately; use `markitdown` for generic conversion) |
| Factual answers from documents, citations, accuracy or hallucination concerns | `bosskuai-grounding` (always on; + `bosskuai-deep-research` for multi-source synthesis, `odl-pdf` for citation-ready PDF extraction) |
| Agent loops: CI/PR/issue sweeps, budgeted triage | loop-engineering — `loop-triage`, `loop-verifier`, `minimal-fix` (+ pattern skills: `ci-triage`, `pr-review-triage`, etc.); release notes: `draft-release-notes` has no local contract, so follow `bosskuai-github-workflow` (Releases and dependencies) |
| Scroll-scrub fly-through / diorama cinematic landing | `scroll-world` (Higgsfield + portable scrub engine; not generic GSAP-only heroes) |
| Agent shell/git safety / destructive command hooks | `dcg` (Destructive Command Guard; install upstream binary separately) |
| Motion craft / easing / gesture / UI polish | emil-skills — `animate` to build (`animate-expo` in Expo), `apple-design` for drag/sheet/momentum physics, `/review-animations` to critique (user-invoked; a model-run critique uses `emil-design-eng`'s Before/After/Why table), `improve-animations` to audit a codebase; never load `animate` and `emil-design-eng` together |
| Frontend library choice (toast, DnD, charts, OTP, …) | `/pick-ui-library` (user-invoked) |
| UI variant exploration behind a live picker | `/prototype` (user-invoked); model-run: `bosskuai-throwaway-prototype` (its UI.md builds switchable variants); `bosskuai-rapid-prototype` for MVP scaffolds |
| Sonner toasts / Swift or SwiftUI code | emil-skills — `ask-sonner`, `write-swift` |
| Reader wants action-first, numbered, no-preamble answers | `i-have-adhd` (explicit `/i-have-adhd`; persists until "stop adhd mode" / "normal mode"); the model cannot load it, so suggest `/i-have-adhd` and use `bosskuai-token-saver` meanwhile |
| Schema, index, and query-plan design; online migrations incl. Laravel/MariaDB | `bosskuai-database-engineering` |
| MySQL/MariaDB engine specifics (InnoDB, replication, pools) | ecc — `mysql-patterns` |
| ORM migration files (Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely, Django, golang-migrate) | ecc — `database-migrations` |
| Python code or pytest | ecc — `python-patterns`, `python-testing` |
| Vue 3 / Pinia outside Nuxt | ecc — `vue-patterns` (`bosskuai-nuxt-development` for Nuxt) |
| Verify actual product behavior, signup/checkout journeys, or CLI smoke checks | `bosskuai-product-verification`; delivery remains `bosskuai-engineering-delivery` |
| Hindsight retain/recall/reflect, bank isolation, or memory integration | `bosskuai-hindsight-memory` (optional runtime); local Markdown remains `bosskuai-permanent-memory-orchestration` |
| Build an MCP server, Playwright E2E, WCAG 2.2 audit, ADR, error/retry design | ecc — `mcp-server-patterns`, `e2e-testing`, `accessibility`, `architecture-decision-records`, `error-handling` |

## Verification

Before declaring done: re-check the request, review changed files, run the relevant check, and state anything not verified.

```bash
python -m bossku skills index --root .   # only if a skill was added/renamed/reworded
python -m bossku validate --root .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

<!-- bosskuai:start -->
BosskuAI is active. Before multi-step work, match the task to an installed skill (use `bossku skills find` when unclear). Select one primary skill and the smallest complementary set justified by distinct prompt concerns; multiple skills are valid. Use Superpowers for process, Anti-Slop for output quality, and verify before completion. Save durable decisions with `bossku remember`. Grounding is always on: say when evidence is insufficient instead of guessing, and ground factual claims in quotes, file:line, or command output.
