# EVM Token Decimals — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Prevent silent decimal mismatch bugs across EVM chains. Covers runtime decimal lookup, chain-aware caching, bridged-token precision drift, and safe normalization for bots, dashboards, and DeFi tools. Use when handling token amounts across EVM chains, or when a balance, price, or transfer amount is off by orders of magnitude.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-cost-optimization`, `error-handling`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. How It Works.
2. Query decimals at runtime.
3. Cache by chain and token.
4. Handle odd tokens defensively.
5. Normalize to 18-decimal WAD in Solidity.
6. TypeScript with ethers.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

Research and review do not authorise signing, trading, booking, purchase or wallet access. Keep any transaction execution behind exact operation/resource scope and user approval; never copy or expose private keys.

## Pass signal

Apply the source “How It Works”, “Query decimals at runtime” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting evm token decimals artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
