# Data Throughput Accelerator — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Diagnose and accelerate large data movement — ingestion, backfill, export, ETL, warehouse loading, manifest catch-up, and table synchronization — by isolating the true bottleneck, benchmarking variants, and codifying the fastest path with a hard accounting block proving rows and timestamps cohere. Use when a pipeline or backfill is too slow and must get faster without losing data correctness.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-performance-profiling`, `bosskuai-subagent-delegation`, `architecture-decision-records`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. First Distinction.
2. Fast Path Heuristics.
3. Workflow.
4. Accounting Output.
5. Guardrails.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

Related supported owners: `architecture-decision-records`, `bosskuai-performance-profiling`, `bosskuai-subagent-delegation`.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

For clinical, compliance, legal, regulatory or financial conclusions, obtain current authoritative sources and an independent review. Treat sample values and rules as examples until verified for the actual jurisdiction/system.

## Pass signal

Complete the source “Workflow”, “Accounting Output” procedure for this task. Keep its resulting artifact, command output or cited evidence, and state what remains unverified.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
