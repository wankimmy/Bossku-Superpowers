# BosskuAI CI/CD Pipelines

Use this skill when the pipeline itself is the work: its shape, speed, gates, secrets, or the way it promotes a build to production.

## How this differs from nearby skills

- **`ci-triage`** (loop-engineering): classifies a failing run as flake, regression, env, or config; this skill designs the pipeline so those classes are rare and obvious.
- **`bosskuai-devops-iac`**: infrastructure, runtime, and rollback design; this skill owns the workflow files that drive them.
- **`bosskuai-github-workflow`**: GitHub operations (issues, PRs, releases, settings); this skill owns `.github/workflows`.
- **`bosskuai-aws-deployment`** / **`bosskuai-vps-docker-deployment`** / **`bosskuai-mobile-app-release`**: the deploy target's specifics; this skill supplies the stages around them.
- **`bosskuai-laravel-verification`**: which Laravel checks to run; this skill schedules them.

## Mindset

- The pipeline is code: reviewed, linted (`actionlint`), versioned, and tested by running it.
- Fast on pull requests, thorough on main, exhaustive nightly. A PR check over ~10 minutes gets ignored.
- Build once, promote the same artifact through environments; never rebuild for production.
- A flaky check is a broken check with a deadline, not a retry button.
- Secrets never reach logs, forks, or PR builds from untrusted branches.

## Pipeline shape

| Trigger | Jobs | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Pull request | lint + typecheck + unit (parallel), integration with service containers, secret scan, dependency audit, build | ≤ 10 min p50 |
| Push to main | PR jobs + image/artifact build tagged with the git SHA + push to registry + deploy staging + smoke test | ≤ 20 min |
| Tag `v*` | changelog, GitHub release, deploy production behind an environment approval, post-deploy checks | approval-gated |
| Nightly | full E2E matrix, load or perf smoke, dependency update PRs, cache warm | unbounded |
| `workflow_dispatch` | manual ops: rollback to a given tag, re-run migrations, data fixes with inputs | logged |

## GitHub Actions rules that matter

- `permissions:` at workflow level set to `contents: read`; grant `id-token: write`, `packages: write`, or `deployments: write` only on the jobs that need them.
- `concurrency: { group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: true }` for PR workflows; never cancel-in-progress on deploy workflows.
- Pin third-party actions to a commit SHA with a version comment; let Dependabot bump them.
- `timeout-minutes` on every job; default is six hours.
- Cache keyed on the lockfile hash with `restore-keys` fallback: `actions/setup-node` with `cache: pnpm`, `actions/cache` for `~/.composer/cache`, `~/.cache/go-build` + `~/go/pkg/mod`, Playwright browsers, and Docker layers via `buildx` `cache-from/to: type=gha`.
- Matrix with `fail-fast: false` while diagnosing, `true` once stable; shard slow test suites by index.
- Monorepos: `dorny/paths-filter` or native `paths:` filters to run only affected packages; Turborepo/Nx remote cache for builds.
- Reusable workflows (`workflow_call`) and composite actions for anything copied twice.
- Environments (`staging`, `production`) with required reviewers, environment-scoped secrets, and deployment branch rules.
- Upload JUnit/Playwright reports as artifacts with short retention; annotate failures inline.
- `pull_request_target` runs with secrets on fork code: avoid it, or never check out the PR head in it.
- Service containers (Postgres, MySQL, Redis) with health checks and tuned settings (`fsync=off` for Postgres in CI); warm the schema once per job, not once per test file.

## Required checks and merge policy

- Branch protection or rulesets: required status checks, up-to-date branch or merge queue, linear history or squash merges, signed commits where policy requires, CODEOWNERS review.
- Merge queue for repos with more than a handful of daily merges; it keeps main green without "update branch" churn.
- Name required checks stably (a job rename silently drops the protection).

## Speed

- Measure first: `gh run list --json durationMs` or the Actions usage report; find the p50 PR pipeline time and the longest job.
- Parallelize independent jobs; shard tests; cache dependencies and build outputs; use larger runners only for the one job that needs them.
- Skip work that cannot matter: docs-only changes, unaffected packages, draft PRs (`if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false` for heavy jobs).
- Self-hosted runners only for hardware, network, or licensing reasons; they are an operations commitment.

## Flakiness policy

- Every flaky test gets an issue, an owner, and a quarantine expiry; quarantined tests run but do not block.
- Retries are allowed only for the quarantined set and are counted; a retry that passes still records the failure.
- Root causes are almost always shared state, real time, network, or unordered assertions; fix those rather than adding sleeps.

## Secrets and supply chain

- OIDC federation to AWS/GCP/Azure instead of stored access keys; role limited to what the deploy job does.
- Environment-scoped secrets; `::add-mask::` for derived values; never `echo` a secret or pass it as a command argument.
- `gitleaks` or `trufflehog` on PRs; `npm audit`/`composer audit`/`govulncheck`/`pip-audit` on a schedule with a policy for what fails the build.
- SBOM generation and image scanning on push (Trivy, ECR scan) for anything shipped.

## Promotion and rollback

- Artifact or image built once on main, tagged with the SHA, promoted by retagging or by environment deploys of the same digest.
- Migrations run as a distinct, gated step and must be backward compatible with the running version.
- Post-deploy smoke: health endpoint, one authenticated request, one queue job.
- Rollback is a `workflow_dispatch` that deploys a previous tag; rehearse it.

## Stack presets

- **Laravel**: PHP matrix, `composer` cache, Pint, PHPStan, Pest with a Postgres/MySQL service, `route:cache`/`view:cache` in the build image (`config:cache` runs at container start), frontend build in a separate job.
- **Nuxt / React**: pnpm store cache, typecheck, ESLint, Vitest, Playwright with browser cache, build with bundle-size check.
- **Go**: module and build cache, `golangci-lint` action, `go test -race`, `govulncheck`, static binary artifact.
- **Expo**: `eas build` with `EXPO_TOKEN`, preview builds per PR, production on tag; see `bosskuai-mobile-app-release`.

## Verification

```bash
actionlint
gh workflow list && gh run list --limit 20
gh run watch <id> --exit-status
```

## Guardrails

- Do not rebuild for production; promote the artifact built on main.
- Do not use unpinned third-party actions or `pull_request_target` with PR-head checkout.
- Do not add blanket retries to hide flakiness.
- Do not deploy from a workflow without an environment gate and a rollback path.
- Do not put secrets in workflow files, job outputs, or artifact contents.
