# Taste Application — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Generate new video against a distilled style pack and cut it into a finished piece - plan takes from the reference's cut rhythm, generate on fal, grade with the pack's measured LUT, cut at the measured cadence, weave in existing footage, composite overlay plates, mint 3D props, and verify the result numerically. Use when the user wants to make a video in a captured style, supplement existing footage, or assemble generated clips into a real edit.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-video-style-distillation`, `bosskuai-video-editing`, `bosskuai-performance-profiling`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. Execution and Delivery Contract.
2. Division of Labour.
3. Generate TAKES, Not Shots.
4. Cutting Rules.
5. Grading Rules.
6. Recovered fal Platform Behavior.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

The full source bundle is retained, including 80 sidecar files. Code is reference-only until its runtime dependencies, input/output paths and requested operation are reviewed. This import did not execute its scripts.

This domain can require a named provider/MCP/API. Discover available tools, verify the documented surface and scope, and report unavailable capabilities. Do not replace a missing provider with invented output.

## Pass signal

Validate generated file manifests, timeline references/durations and exported deliverables with the source verification procedure; provider costs need scoped approval.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
