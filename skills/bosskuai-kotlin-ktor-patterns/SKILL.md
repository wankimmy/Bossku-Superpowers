# Ktor Server Patterns — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Ktor server patterns including routing DSL, plugins, authentication, Koin DI, kotlinx.serialization, WebSockets, and testApplication testing. Use when building a Ktor server — routing, plugins, auth, DI, serialization, or tests.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-fastapi-development`, `bosskuai-go-development`, `bosskuai-kotlin-testing`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. Application Structure.
2. Standard Ktor Project Layout.
3. Application Entry Point.
4. Routing DSL.
5. Basic Routes.
6. Route Organization with Authenticated Routes.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

This domain can require a named provider/MCP/API. Discover available tools, verify the documented surface and scope, and report unavailable capabilities. Do not replace a missing provider with invented output.

For clinical, compliance, legal, regulatory or financial conclusions, obtain current authoritative sources and an independent review. Treat sample values and rules as examples until verified for the actual jurisdiction/system.

## Pass signal

Apply the source “Application Structure”, “Standard Ktor Project Layout” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting ktor server patterns artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
