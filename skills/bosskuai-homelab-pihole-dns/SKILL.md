# Homelab Pi-hole DNS — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Pi-hole installation, blocklist management, DNS-over-HTTPS setup, DHCP integration, local DNS records, and troubleshooting broken DNS resolution on a home network. Use when the task explicitly involves Pi-hole — installing it, managing blocklists, configuring DoH or DHCP, adding local DNS records, or diagnosing DNS resolution with Pi-hole in the path.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-homelab-network-readiness`, `bosskuai-homelab-network-setup`, `bosskuai-homelab-wireguard-vpn`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. How Pi-hole Works.
2. Docker (Recommended).
3. docker-compose.yml.
4. Bare-Metal Install (Raspberry Pi OS / Debian / Ubuntu).
5. Step 1: Assign a static IP (edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf on Pi OS).
6. Add at the bottom:.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

This domain can require a named provider/MCP/API. Discover available tools, verify the documented surface and scope, and report unavailable capabilities. Do not replace a missing provider with invented output.

## Pass signal

Complete the source “Prefer Cloudflare's package repository for automatic signed package verification.”, “If you download a binary directly, pin a release version and verify its checksum.” procedure for this task. Keep its resulting artifact, command output or cited evidence, and state what remains unverified.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
