# BosskuAI React Development

Use this skill when the frontend is React and the answer depends on React's rendering model, hook rules, or ecosystem choices rather than on generic UI advice.

## How this differs from nearby skills

- **`bosskuai-nuxt-development`**: Vue/Nuxt equivalent; do not mix conventions.
- **`bosskuai-expo-react-native`**: React on mobile; different primitives, navigation, and performance model.
- **`bosskuai-ui-ux-design-to-code`** / **`bosskuai-taste`**: what the interface should look like; this skill builds it correctly in React.
- **`bosskuai-web-performance`**: Core Web Vitals and bundle strategy; this skill fixes React-level render cost.
- **`animate`** (emil-skills): motion craft; this skill wires it, it does not design it.

## Mindset

- Server state and client state are different problems; treat fetched data as a cache, not as component state.
- Derive, don't synchronize: if a value can be computed from props or other state, compute it during render.
- Components render; hooks orchestrate; modules hold logic that has nothing to do with React.
- TypeScript strict is the baseline; `any` in a component boundary is a bug report waiting to happen.
- Accessibility is correctness, not polish.

## Orient before changing anything

1. `package.json`: React major (19 changes `ref`, `forwardRef`, Actions, `use()`), framework (Vite SPA, Next.js App or Pages Router, Remix/React Router 7 framework mode), TypeScript `strict`.
2. State and data layers already present: TanStack Query, SWR, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, Apollo. Use what exists.
3. Lint config: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (`rules-of-hooks`, `exhaustive-deps`) must be on. React Compiler enabled? Then manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` is mostly noise.
4. Test stack: Vitest/Jest + Testing Library, MSW, Playwright/Cypress.
5. Design system or component library (shadcn/ui, Radix, MUI, Chakra) and its theming approach.

## Rules that catch most React bugs

- `useEffect` is for synchronizing with something outside React (subscriptions, DOM APIs, timers). Not for derived state, not for reacting to a click, not for chaining state updates.
- Fetching in `useEffect` without an abort or ignore flag races on fast navigation; use TanStack Query, a router loader, or `AbortController`.
- Missing or index-based `key` on dynamic lists corrupts state on reorder.
- Objects, arrays, and functions created during render are new every time: they retrigger effects, break `memo`, and cause context consumers to re-render. Move them out, memoize, or split the context.
- Context value objects re-render every consumer; split by update frequency (auth vs theme vs high-churn UI state).
- Storing derived or prop-mirrored data in `useState` creates two sources of truth.
- Conditional or early-returned hooks violate hook order.
- Switching an input between controlled and uncontrolled (undefined → value) throws away user input.
- No error boundary around data-driven regions means one bad response blanks the page; pair Suspense boundaries with error boundaries.
- Next.js App Router: server components cannot use hooks or browser APIs; `"use client"` at the wrong level drags the whole subtree to the client; server actions must validate input like any API; `fetch` caching semantics changed in 15 (uncached by default).
- Next.js 16: `middleware.ts` renamed `proxy.ts` (middleware deprecated), Cache Components with `"use cache"`, Turbopack is the default bundler.
- React 19: `ref` is a normal prop; `useActionState`/`useOptimistic` replace hand-rolled pending states; `use()` reads promises and context conditionally; check library compatibility before upgrading.

## State decision table

| State kind | Put it in |
|---|---|
| Shareable UI state (filters, tabs, pagination) | the URL (search params) |
| Component-local | `useState` / `useReducer` |
| Low-frequency global (auth user, theme, locale) | context, memoized value |
| High-frequency client state shared widely | Zustand or Jotai |
| Server data (lists, details, mutations) | TanStack Query with keys, invalidation, optimistic updates |
| Complex event-sourced or already present | Redux Toolkit |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod schema; server errors mapped to fields |

## Performance in React terms

- Measure first with React DevTools Profiler; fix the component that renders too often or too expensively, not everything.
- Virtualize long lists (TanStack Virtual); paginate or window server data.
- Code-split by route and by heavy feature (`lazy` + Suspense); keep the initial bundle for the first screen only.
- `memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback` only after measuring, or not at all with the React Compiler.
- Avoid layout thrash: batch DOM reads/writes; use `useLayoutEffect` only for measurement that must precede paint.
- Hand bundle size, images, fonts, and Core Web Vitals to `bosskuai-web-performance`.

## Accessibility baseline

- Native elements first (`button`, `a`, `label`, `dialog`); ARIA only when HTML lacks the semantics.
- Focus management on route change and modal open/close; visible focus ring; Escape closes overlays.
- Every input has a label; errors are announced (`aria-describedby`, `aria-live`).
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text; honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Testing

- Query like a user: `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`; avoid test ids unless nothing else is stable.
- `userEvent` over `fireEvent`; MSW for network; no mocking of hooks or internal state.
- One Playwright flow per critical path (auth, checkout, core CRUD); screenshot only where layout is the requirement.
- Type-level tests for public component props when they are a contract.

## Verification

```bash
tsc --noEmit
eslint . --max-warnings=0
vitest run            # or jest
playwright test       # critical flows
vite build && npx vite-bundle-visualizer   # or next build && ANALYZE=true
```

## Guardrails

- Do not add a state library to solve a problem TanStack Query or the URL already solves.
- Do not silence `exhaustive-deps`; fix the dependency or restructure.
- Do not fetch in `useEffect` when the framework provides loaders or server components.
- Do not ship `any` at component or API boundaries.
- Do not treat a green unit suite as proof the flow works; run the Playwright path.

## Output format
