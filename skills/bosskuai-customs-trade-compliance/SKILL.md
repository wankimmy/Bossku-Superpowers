# Customs & Trade Compliance — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Codified customs and trade compliance expertise — HS/HTS tariff classification with GRI rules, commercial invoices and entry documentation, Incoterms 2020, FTA qualification and duty optimization (USMCA, RCEP, FTZs, drawback), denied-party screening, and penalty mitigation across US, EU, UK, and APAC jurisdictions. Use when classifying goods, preparing import/export documentation, screening restricted parties, responding to customs audits or CF-28/penalty notices, or optimizing duties.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-production-scheduling`, `bosskuai-energy-procurement`, `bosskuai-inventory-demand-planning`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. Role and Context.
2. How It Works.
3. Core Knowledge.
4. HS Tariff Classification.
5. Documentation Requirements.
6. Incoterms 2020.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

This domain can require a named provider/MCP/API. Discover available tools, verify the documented surface and scope, and report unavailable capabilities. Do not replace a missing provider with invented output.

For clinical, compliance, legal, regulatory or financial conclusions, obtain current authoritative sources and an independent review. Treat sample values and rules as examples until verified for the actual jurisdiction/system.

## Pass signal

Apply the source “Role and Context”, “How It Works” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting customs & trade compliance artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
