# Flox Environments — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Create reproducible, cross-platform (macOS/Linux) development environments with Flox, a declarative Nix-based environment manager. Use when setting up project toolchains, installing system-level dependencies (compilers, databases, native libs), pinning exact package versions for a team, onboarding developers, running local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka), or solving 'works on my machine' problems — including agent/vibe-coding setups that need project-scoped tools without sudo. Also use when the user mentions .flox/, manifest.toml, flox activate, or FloxHub.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-continuous-learning`, `bosskuai-agent-architecture-audit`, `bosskuai-autonomous-loops`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. Core Concepts.
2. Essential Commands.
3. Manifest Structure.
4. .flox/env/manifest.toml.
5. Packages to install — the core of the environment.
6. Static environment variables.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

Related supported owners: `bosskuai-agent-architecture-audit`, `bosskuai-autonomous-loops`, `bosskuai-continuous-learning`.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

## Pass signal

Apply the source “Core Concepts”, “Essential Commands” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting flox environments artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
