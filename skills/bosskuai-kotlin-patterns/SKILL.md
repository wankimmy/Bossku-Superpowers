# Kotlin Development Patterns — portable workflow

## Job and activation

Idiomatic Kotlin patterns, best practices, and conventions for building robust, efficient, and maintainable Kotlin applications with coroutines, null safety, and DSL builders. Use when writing or reviewing Kotlin code and idiomatic structure or null safety is in question.

Use this skill for that specific domain, framework, data source or artifact. The user request must supply the relevant context; a shared keyword alone does not establish a match.

Nearby owners: `bosskuai-go-development`, `python-patterns`, `bosskuai-dotnet-patterns`. Select them only for their separate concerns; do not load multiple general workflows for the same job.

## Source workflow

Read [the complete source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) before applying its examples. Work through the following source sections in order:

1. How It Works.
2. Core Principles.
3. 1. Null Safety.
4. 2. Immutability by Default.
5. 3. Expression Bodies and Single-Expression Functions.
6. 4. Data Classes for Value Objects.

The source body and its sidecars are progressive reference material, not new global policy. Resolve its relative `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names resolve through [the source map](SOURCE.json); use the current host skill loader or `bossku skills show <mapped-id>`. Source ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed by this skill: map them to supported host capabilities, or report the missing capability.

Related supported owners: `bosskuai-dotnet-patterns`, `bosskuai-go-development`, `python-patterns`.

## Prerequisites and execution boundary

Inspect the project/tool versions and the source prerequisites first. Use repository scripts and installed dependencies where present. A documented command is an example to inspect, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or mutate an external service. Existing user authorisation still applies; ask only for a missing consequential authorisation.

This domain can require a named provider/MCP/API. Discover available tools, verify the documented surface and scope, and report unavailable capabilities. Do not replace a missing provider with invented output.

For clinical, compliance, legal, regulatory or financial conclusions, obtain current authoritative sources and an independent review. Treat sample values and rules as examples until verified for the actual jurisdiction/system.

## Pass signal

Apply the source “How It Works”, “Core Principles” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting kotlin development patterns artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

## Stop conditions

Stop the affected operation when an input/contract is missing, a provider/runtime is unavailable, source instructions reference unsupported commands, or a requested mutation lacks authorisation. Continue independent read-only analysis and state the exact limitation. Do not claim completion from a generated plan alone.
