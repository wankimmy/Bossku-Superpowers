# Homelab VLAN Segmentation — portable workflow

Segmenting home networks into VLANs for IoT, guest, trusted, and server traffic using UniFi, pfSense/OPNsense, and MikroTik — including switch trunk config, firewall rules, and wireless SSID mapping. Use when splitting a home network into IoT, guest, trusted, and server VLANs on UniFi, pfSense/OPNsense, or MikroTik.

Use it only when the request supplies this domain, framework, data source or artifact; a shared keyword is not a match. Related skills, each for its own concern: `bosskuai-homelab-network-readiness`, `bosskuai-homelab-network-setup`, `bosskuai-homelab-wireguard-vpn`, `bosskuai-homelab-pihole-dns`.

## Workflow

Read [the source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) first, then work through these sections in order:

1. How It Works.
2. VLAN Design Template.
3. UniFi Configuration.
4. Create Networks in UniFi Controller.
5. Map SSIDs to VLANs (UniFi).
6. UniFi Firewall Rules (Traffic Rules).

- Resolve its `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names map through [SOURCE.json](SOURCE.json) (`bossku skills show <id>`). ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed: use what this host has, or say what is missing.
- Check the project's tool versions and the source prerequisites first. A documented command is an example, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or change an external service.
- It can need a named provider, MCP server or API: check that it is available and in scope, report it when it is not, and never invent its output.

## Done when

Apply the source “How It Works”, “VLAN Design Template” guidance to the concrete request. Return the resulting homelab vlan segmentation artifact or diagnosis with source/command evidence for each conclusion.

If an input, provider, runtime or authorisation is missing, stop that step, carry on with read-only analysis, and say exactly what is missing. A generated plan alone is not completion.
