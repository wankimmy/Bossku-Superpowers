# Spring Boot Verification Loop — portable workflow

Run the full Spring Boot verification loop — Maven or Gradle build, SpotBugs, PMD, and Checkstyle static analysis, unit and Testcontainers integration tests with JaCoCo coverage, OWASP dependency and secret scans, and diff review — producing a pass/fail readiness report. Use when preparing a Spring Boot pull request, validating coverage thresholds, or running pre-deploy verification.

Use it only when the request supplies this domain, framework, data source or artifact; a shared keyword is not a match. Related skills, each for its own concern: `bosskuai-django-verification`, `bosskuai-quarkus-verification`, `verification-before-completion`.

## Workflow

Read [the source workflow](references/upstream/SKILL.md) first, then work through these sections in order:

1. Phase 1: Build.
2. or.
3. Phase 2: Static Analysis.
4. Phase 3: Tests + Coverage.
5. Unit Tests.
6. Integration Tests with Testcontainers.

- Resolve its `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and template paths against `references/upstream/`, not the project root. Source skill names map through [SOURCE.json](SOURCE.json) (`bossku skills show <id>`). ECC slash commands, agent names and package-root paths are not installed: use what this host has, or say what is missing.
- Check the project's tool versions and the source prerequisites first. A documented command is an example, not permission to install packages, add an account, expose secrets, upload private content or change an external service.
- It can need a named provider, MCP server or API: check that it is available and in scope, report it when it is not, and never invent its output.

## Done when

Complete the source “Spring Boot Verification Loop”, “Output Template” procedure for this task. Keep its resulting artifact, command output or cited evidence, and state what remains unverified.

If an input, provider, runtime or authorisation is missing, stop that step, carry on with read-only analysis, and say exactly what is missing. A generated plan alone is not completion.
