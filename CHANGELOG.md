# Changelog

## Unreleased — Lean profile, session hooks, and real benchmarks

BosskuAI used to put 234 skill names in front of the model in every session and trusted routing numbers measured on the prompts it was tuned against. This release makes the per-session cost small, helps the agent open the right skill and remember a project's rules across sessions, and measures all of it on real agents with the results kept in the repository.

- **`lean` install profile.** About 25 skills are listed with one short sentence each; the other ~210 move to `~/.bosskuai/library` and are one `bossku skills show <id>` away. New `bosskuai-skill-finder` skill (the agent runs `bossku skills find`, then opens the pick), `skills/lean.json` (the listed set and the short sentences) and `bossku skills show <id>`. `validate` checks the list: at most 48 skills, 150 characters each. `core` and `full` are unchanged.
- **Compact skills.** 20 first-party skills now ship a short `SKILL.md` (the checklist: 41 KB in total instead of 143 KB) and keep the full text in `reference.md` (every line of the old `SKILL.md` is still there), which the agent opens only when it needs the detail. A loaded skill is re-read on every later turn, so a shorter core costs less all session. Vendored skills are untouched, and every frontmatter is byte-identical.
- **Skill hint hook** (`bossku skill-hint`, `UserPromptSubmit`). Names the one or two skills that fit the prompt and tells the agent to load them first. Silent for short prompts and weak matches.
- **Verify gate** (`bossku verify-gate`, `Stop`). If the agent edited code and never ran anything afterwards, it is sent back once to run it. A second rule catches a request for a change that was answered by pasting code into the reply without editing any file. Silent when the agent already did its job. `BOSSKU_VERIFY_GATE=0` turns it off. Each reminder is sent once per turn and counted from the transcript, so it can never loop (a second "run it now" reminder made a small model invent tool names for 30+ turns), and any error lets the agent finish.
- **Project notes at session start** (`bossku session-brief`, `SessionStart`, and `bossku memory-brief`). The newest notes, at most 1,000 characters, so the agent no longer runs `memory-path` and reads files. A rule the user states counts as a note worth saving, so a later session does not break it.
- **Router.** Evidence floors for the automatic stack (a skill needs a minimum score and 40% of the top score) and an `unsure` flag instead of a confident wrong answer. On 73 held-out requests written without seeing the router: first pick right 59% → 75%, every part of a multi-part request covered 40% → 58%. The fixes behind this were found on the other 87 requests only.
- **`bossku remember` says when it saved.** The output now starts with `"saved": true` and a sentence. Before, `"vault": {"status": "skipped"}` (no vault configured) read like a failure; in tests a model retried three times, wrote a junk note and hand-edited the memory files, costing six turns.
- **Shorter, concrete always-on text.** The project block and the global memory block say what to do (list the requirements, make exactly that change, run the tests, batch independent tool calls, save only what a future session needs) in fewer words. On the dev tasks the batching line cut a strong model's tokens by about a quarter at the same pass rate (18 runs each).
- **Benchmark harness** (`scripts/benchmark_agent.py`): runs real Claude Code headless against hidden-test coding tasks, with and without BosskuAI, on Claude models or Ollama Cloud. Baseline isolation is checked by a canary; real notes are never touched; failures are counted, not dropped. 26 coding tasks (9 dev, 17 test), 31 harder tasks (17 dev, 14 test), 10 two-session memory tasks, HumanEval sampling, 160 blind skill-search prompts (`scripts/benchmark_routing_heldout.py`). Results live in `benchmarks/results/`; the README charts are drawn from them by `scripts/make_charts.py`. See [docs/benchmarks](docs/benchmarks/README.md).
- **Fixes.** `bossku skills show` crashed on a Windows pipe when a skill contained an arrow or a dash (output is UTF-8 now); the global `--home`/`--root` options were ignored after a subcommand (a run could write to the real home); `set_description` glued the closing `---` onto the description; `bossku uninstall --purge` now also removes hooks and the library.

## Unreleased — Claude practices and Hindsight

- Applied the reviewed Claude Code README's skill-design, discovery, startup-context, permissions, and verification guidance to the existing first-party skills; added a traceable coverage review.
- Added `bosskuai-product-verification` for observed user journeys and CLI smoke checks, with routing regressions.
- Added `bosskuai-hindsight-memory` and an optional retain/recall/reflect integration playbook with scoped banks, curated-note ingestion, provenance checks, and Markdown fallback. No Hindsight runtime or automatic capture is installed.
- Fixed `bossku init`, validator, and doctor accepting instruction imports inside code examples; preserve existing text and avoid duplicate imports on repeat initialization.
- Corrected stale first-party guidance about the existing sync-hook defaults and `scripts/` wrappers.

## Unreleased

Always-on grounding: Anthropic hallucination-reduction and output-consistency techniques as a default Bossku trait.

- New skill `bosskuai-grounding` with Persistence (not switched off by "normal mode"), four moves (admit the gap, quote first, claim/source/retract, source-only), memory admission, and agent interactions. Added to the `core` profile.
- New checklist `references/checklists/grounding-checklist.md`. Skill-creator checklist now asks for an input/output example when format quality depends on it.
- `AGENTS.md`: `## Grounding (always on)` section and pack-routing row. All five agent contracts list the skill; auditor treats unsupported claims as findings; final-reviewer REVISE covers unsourced evidence.
- `bosskuai-deep-research`: quote-first deep-read and post-draft retraction. `bosskuai-prompt-optimizer`: Source of truth in Phase 4, grounding in optimized prompts.
- Curated triggers in `bossku/index.py`; routing case in `tests/test_routing.py`; managed-block sentence in `bossku/init_project.py`; Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/bosskuai.mdc`; sync test that AGENTS.md, the `.mdc`, and the init block all contain `Grounding`.

Skill and rule audit: dead ends removed, router index cleaned. No skill body was trimmed; vendored skills are untouched.

- **Agents usable in Claude Code.** `final-reviewer` had no frontmatter (the plugin exposed it as a generic all-tools agent); it now has one, and its `[BOSSKUAI]` prefix block is gone because it contradicted the JSON-only output contract. Plugin agents declared tools that do not exist (`log`, `memory`, `db_query`) and model values Claude Code does not accept (`review`, `coding`, `reasoning`), so the executor and auditor could not run the verification commands their contracts require. They now use `Read/Grep/Glob/Bash` (+ `Edit/Write` for the executor) with `inherit`, and `sonnet` for the executor, matching the plan-strong / execute-cheaper split.
- **No phantom agents or files.** The orchestrator told agents to "adopt the matching contract" for 14 specialists with no file in `agents/`, and referenced `skill-detector.md`, `active-continuation.md`, and `TaskCheckoutService::checkout`. Each role is now a real agent plus the skill that holds the expertise (for example, review = auditor + `bosskuai-rigorous-code-review`). Continuation points at `.bossku/memory/handoff.md`. Same fix in `bosskuai-prompt-optimizer` and `bosskuai-autonomous-loops`.
- **No alias ids as load instructions.** 16 references told agents to load alias ids (`bosskuai-bug-finding`, `bosskuai-zoom-out`, `bosskuai-agent-security-hardening`, ...). The CLI resolves aliases, but Claude Code's Skill tool does not, so each was a guaranteed failed call. They now name the real skill.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: `review-animations`, `pick-ui-library`, and `prototype` are marked user-invoked (`/name`). They set `disable-model-invocation`, so routing the model to them only produced failed calls.
- **`bosskuai-ai-model-selection`**: Fable 5.1 (`claude-fable-5-1`) replaces Fable 5, Opus 5.5 added as name-only, and Sonnet 5 corrected to $2/$10 (was $3/$15), per the `claude-api` reference.
- **Recovered harness edits in the agents.** An earlier harness session's agent improvements survived only in the installed `~/.claude/agents` copies. They are merged back: the auditor runs cheap verification itself and quotes the real output, the executor reads `DESIGN.md` before UI edits and names `bosskuai-ponytail` + `bosskuai-rigorous-code-review` for the de-sloppify pass, the planner gets read-only Bash, and the orchestrator lists every specialist role as agent + skill, claims work in `.bossku/memory/handoff.md`, and runs loops with exit conditions named up front. The UI screenshot gates stay out until `agents/designer.md` and `scripts/shot.mjs` are committed.
- **Claude Code sync hook on Windows.** `bossku hooks install` wrote the hook command as an unquoted `C:\...\bossku.EXE sync-hook`; Claude Code runs hooks through Git Bash, which drops the backslashes, so the Obsidian sync at Stop and SessionEnd never ran. The command is now a quoted forward-slash path, and an install repairs its own stale entries instead of reporting `already_installed`.
- **Six-lane skill review.** Every one of the 240 skills was read against its domain (engineering build, engineering process, visual design, motion, marketing, sales), with version-sensitive claims checked against official docs. First-party fixes applied, among them: `bosskuai-saas-billing-ops` now requires webhook signature verification and uses Stripe's real status strings; `bosskuai-greptile-review-loop` stages only the files it changed, gates each push on tests, and never resolves a human reviewer's thread; `bosskuai-aws-deployment` drops App Runner (closed to new customers) for ECS Express Mode and S3-native Terraform locking; `bosskuai-laravel-security` targets the Laravel 11+ skeleton; `bosskuai-malaysia-pdpa-privacy` states the 2025 amendment duties (72-hour breach notice, DPO); `bosskuai-cybersecurity-risk` uses OWASP Top 10:2025; `config:cache` moves from image build to container start; `bosskuai-paid-acquisition-monetization` stops spend at CAC > LTV; `bosskuai-seo-geo` carries corrected AI-crawler and rich-result facts; `bosskuai-taste` no longer asks for invented names, numbers, or logos; GSAP, R3F, Lenis, Expo, and App Store facts are current. Vendored bugs are drafted as upstream issues in `references/audits/2026-09-26-upstream-issues.md`.
- **Retired and removed skills.** `bosskuai-human-output`, `bosskuai-recipes`, `bosskuai-engineering-principles` (its goal table moved into `bosskuai-engineering-delivery`), and `bosskuai-workspace-assistant` are now aliases. `taste-skill-v1`, `gpt-tasteskill`, and `stitch-skill` are no longer vendored (recorded under `excluded` in `vendored.json`). `x402` stays vendored but is never installed: it prints wallet keys. Hallmark's upstream moved to `Nutlope/hallmark`, and its theme tokens are vendored at `site/css/tokens.css`.
- **Router.** About 60 trigger, exclusion, and role changes; skills with `disable-model-invocation` are flagged `user_invoked` and `bossku skills find` says to hand them to the user as `/<id>`; phrase matching ignores hyphens ("founder-led" = "founder led"); a stack holds one design-direction skill. Measured: the 42 misroutes the review found now route correctly, the 51-case contract stays 51/51, and an independent 65-query held-out set moves from 55 to 58 top-1 with top-3 unchanged at 63.
- **Strict frontmatter check.** Nine descriptions rewritten during the review were unquoted and contained `: `, which real YAML parsers reject; hosts then dropped the description and listed the skill by its H1 title. They are quoted now, and `bossku validate` fails on any unquoted value containing `: ` or ` #`, which Bossku's own lenient parser used to accept.
- **Installer and CLI.** `bossku install` prunes managed skill copies it no longer ships (retired, excluded, or off-profile) and copies `site/`; `--project` defaults to the current directory for `remember` and `sync`; `bossku init` writes the antislop pointer block so its install wizard and usage question do not block agents.
- **Router index.** The phrase extractor split quoted examples on `,` and `/` (`"A/B test,"` became `the user mentions "a` + `b test`), read apostrophes as quote marks (`"analytics isn't working"` became `analytics isn`), matched `Use this when` inside "whenever", and cut words at a 200-character cap. The frontmatter parser also left `\"` escapes in double-quoted descriptions, so every `community-marketing` phrase was garbage. Phrases went from 1,659 to 888 with none left carrying stray quotes or third-person scaffolding. Routing is unchanged: the committed contract stays 51/51, and a 65-query held-out set stays 55/65 top-1 and 63/65 top-3.

## v2.1.0 - Upstream pack sync, i-have-adhd, and a curated ECC subset

Synced every vendored pack that has a checkout under `../ai-skills` against upstream HEAD (2026-09-07). Vendored copies are now byte-identical to upstream again (modulo CRLF); the routing wording Bossku had previously written into vendored descriptions moved into `CURATED_TRIGGERS`, per the contract in `AGENTS.md`.

- **superpowers** (obra/superpowers v6.3.0): brainstorming gained the three-path router (spike / bounded / architectural) and a red-flags table; TDD now ships `writing-good-tests.md` (replaces `testing-anti-patterns.md`); subagent-driven-development gained `re-review-prompt.md` and updated scripts; systematic-debugging `find-polluter.sh` fixes; using-superpowers gained Gemini and Hermes tool references; every other skill picked up the July rationalization-table refactors.
- **hallmark**: 21st theme **Grid** (`references/themes/grid.md`), nav archetype range fix, custom-theme and macrostructure updates.
- **emil-skills**: re-synced 9 skills and added 3 new ones - `animate-expo` (Reanimated / Gesture Handler / haptics construction skill), `ask-sonner` (Sonner toast guide + API reference), `write-swift` (modern Swift 6 guide). Pack is now 12 skills.
- **graphify** (0.9.55): upstream no longer keeps a static `SKILL.md`; re-vendored from the Agent-Skills template `graphify/skill-agents.md` plus the new `references/` sidecar (8 files: extraction spec, query, exports, update, hooks, transcribe, add/watch, GitHub merge). Documented the source paths in `docs/third-party.md`.
- **taste-skill**, **loop-engineering** (all 12), **marketingskills**, **scroll-world**: verified against upstream; taste-skill and loop-engineering descriptions reverted to upstream text, with compensating curated triggers for `loop-budget`, `loop-constraints`, `loop-triage`, `loop-verifier`, `minimal-fix`, `post-merge-scan`, `changelog-scan`, and `taste-skill`. The 7 loop pattern skills are taken from `starters/<loop>/.claude/skills/`.
- **dcg**: thin skill refreshed against upstream v0.6.9 (`DCG_CONFIG`, `DCG_FAIL_CLOSED`, config precedence).
- **New pack `i-have-adhd`** (ayghri/i-have-adhd, MIT): action-first, numbered, no-preamble output shape. Explicit `/i-have-adhd`; persists until "stop adhd mode" / "normal mode". Routed in `AGENTS.md` and listed as an overlap with `bosskuai-human-output` / `bosskuai-token-saver`.
- **New pack `ecc`** (affaan-m/ECC, MIT): a curated 10-skill subset that fills library gaps rather than the whole 280-skill catalogue - `mysql-patterns`, `database-migrations`, `error-handling`, `mcp-server-patterns`, `e2e-testing`, `accessibility`, `architecture-decision-records`, `vue-patterns`, `python-patterns`, `python-testing`. Each is a single self-contained `SKILL.md` with no ECC-only tooling references. Skipped on purpose: ECC `security-review` (would shadow the Claude Code built-in of the same name; Bossku keeps `bosskuai-cybersecurity-risk` + `bosskuai-laravel-security`), and anything overlapping an existing Bossku skill (deployment, git workflow, onboarding, loop design, redis, seo).
- `bossku/skills.py`: `origin` added to `KNOWN_FRONTMATTER_KEYS` (ECC's provenance marker). `bossku/index.py`: curated triggers + explicit roles for every new skill. Routing fix: triggers are lowercased at index build, so curated phrases written with a capital (e.g. "what should I use for toasts") now earn their exact-phrase bonus against the lowercased query; top-1 on the routing contract went from 0.95 to 0.98. Routing contract in `tests/test_routing.py` extended with 13 cases for the new skills.
- Versions aligned at 2.1.0 across `pyproject.toml` and all plugin manifests. Library is now ~240 skills / 14 vendored packs. Not synced (no checkout under `ai-skills`): `browser-use`, `graft`, `markitdown`.

## v1.13.0 - Cross-repo portability and session token optimization

- **Plugin now carries the full harness**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exposes `commands` (11 commands moved from `.claude/commands/` to `commands/`), `hooks` (new `hooks/hooks.json`), and a curated `agents` array — so skills, commands, agents, and hooks all work in **any** repo the plugin is enabled for, not just this one.
- **Portable hooks**: plugin hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths. New `session-start-context.sh` (SessionStart) injects the compact BosskuAI contract + resolved memory home into model context once per session in every repo — replacing the per-prompt stderr reminder that never reached the model. `common.sh` gained `resolve_bossku_home()` ($BOSSKU_HOME → project → sibling Bossku-AI checkout → plugin root) so shared memory works from sibling projects with zero config. `write_hook_output` no longer echoes hook-input JSON to stdout; edit counter is now session-scoped. Repo-local `.claude/settings.json` hooks emptied to avoid double-firing (mcp-health-check stays opt-in there — per-MCP-call bash spawn is too hot for a default).
- **Curated subagents**: plugin exposes the 24 editor-appropriate agents only; the 10 Laravel runtime pipeline personas (orchestrator, executor, auditor, clarification, designer, model-router, writer, final-reviewer, direct-answer, skill-detector) no longer leak into the editor's Agent list. Frontmatter normalized on editor agents (valid Claude Code `tools`, `model: opus` instead of runtime role names).
- **Token optimization**: 25 longest/deprecated skill descriptions rewritten as tight trigger statements (7,313 → 4,606 chars; ~680 tokens saved per session, every session, keywords preserved). Deprecated aliases reduced to one-liners.
- Versions aligned at 1.13.0 across `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, root `plugin.json`, both marketplaces, and `skill-index.json`. Removed stray broken `Bossku-AI` symlink at repo root.

## v1.12.0 - Loop architectures, prompt optimizer, 5 new agents, and flows

- Added `bosskuai-autonomous-loops` (ECC port): loop architecture catalogue — sequential `claude -p` pipelines, infinite agentic loop, continuous PR loop, de-sloppify pattern, Ralphinho RFC-driven DAG — plus a new section documenting BosskuAI's own runtime revise loop (`max_revision_rounds`, ExecutorStuckDetector) as the built-in pattern.
- Added `bosskuai-prompt-optimizer` (ECC port, heavily remapped): advisory-only prompt diagnosis and rewriting that matches intent/scope/stack to the bosskuai skill+agent roster and outputs ready-to-paste optimized prompts.
- Added 5 editor-mode agent contracts: `loop-operator` (drives autonomous loop architectures: exit conditions, context bridging, stall detection), `performance-optimizer` (measure → change one variable → re-measure ratchet), `database-reviewer` (migration/rollback/index/tenant-scope gate), `code-simplifier` (de-sloppify pass after green, separate context from author), `incident-responder` (stabilize → verify → prevent with blameless postmortem).
- Enhanced core agents: orchestrator gained a **Flows table** (10 task-shape → chain → loop-owner routes) and council/introspection wiring in runtime-core; planner gained DAG decomposition rules + complexity-tier table; executor gained de-sloppify handoff + introspection-on-cap + Laravel skill wiring; security-reviewer gained laravel-security/prompt-injection-defense/tenant-isolation wiring; auditor gained agent-architecture-audit, laravel-verification gate, and database-reviewer delegation.
- skill-index.json v1.12.0 (105 skills); AGENTS.md roster and specialist list updated; plugin.json 1.3.0.

## v1.11.0 - ECC agent-stack, decision, and Laravel skills

- Added 4 agent-stack/decision skills ported from ECC (affaan-m/ECC): `bosskuai-agent-architecture-audit` (12-layer agent diagnostic, grounded to the BosskuAI pipeline), `bosskuai-agent-introspection` (capture → diagnose → contained recovery for stuck/degraded agent runs), `bosskuai-council` (four-voice decision council), `bosskuai-context-budget` (context overhead audit incl. runtime persona injection).
- Added 3 manual-only Laravel specialists for the `app/` backend and any Laravel repo: `bosskuai-laravel-security`, `bosskuai-laravel-tdd`, `bosskuai-laravel-verification`.
- Folded the ECC continuous-learning-v2 instinct model into `bosskuai-continuous-learning`: atomic confidence-weighted instincts under `ai-assistant/memory/instincts/`, promotion ladder, runtime parallel to `LearningEngine`.
- Registered all 7 skills in `skill-index.json` (v1.11.0, 103 skills) and `AGENTS.md` (new "Agent-stack & decision skills" and "Laravel stack specialists" rosters).
- Verified greptile skills (`bosskuai-greptile-review-loop`, `bosskuai-pr-check`) remain in sync with upstream greptile-skills (latest: edited-comment handling, GitLab + Perforce support).

## Unreleased

- Added the complete Apache-2.0 upstream `odl-pdf` skill bundle unchanged, with prompt-aware routing for OpenDataLoader, OCR, structured PDF extraction, tables, bounding boxes, and citation-ready RAG. Generic document conversion remains routed to `markitdown`; unrelated PDF operations do not trigger the skill.
- Added the six-skill MIT `anti-slop` pack unchanged, plus curated prompt routing and a final-gate contract for UI, responsive layout, copy, generated comments, and code artifacts.
- Added `bosskuai-headroom` as a guarded context-compression operating skill. It checks for the optional runtime and never installs packages or changes proxy/provider routing without a request.
- `bossku skills find` now emits a `recommended_stack` so multi-concern prompts can select one primary and the smallest non-overlapping complementary set. Superpowers phase skills are explicitly composed with domain and Anti-Slop skills.
- Added `bossku skills audit` for description-token cost, long-body counts, provenance groups, and relative-link integrity. Compacted every custom description over 300 characters; despite seven new skills, total always-loaded description text fell by 2,970 characters (about 743 tokens) from the pre-change baseline.
- `bossku install` and `bossku update` now deploy shared `references/` into both user skill roots and handle read-only OneDrive files during reinstall/uninstall. Validation rejects broken custom relative links while reporting vendored upstream gaps separately.
- Aligned the CLI and new-project metadata version with the 2.1.0 package/manifests; `bossku doctor` no longer reports the stale 2.0.0 internal version.

- **Session-end sync hooks — `bossku hooks install`**: new `bossku/hooks.py` wires an opt-in `Stop`/session-end hook into Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`), Cursor (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`), Codex (`~/.codex/hooks.json`), and OpenCode (a dedicated `~/.config/opencode/plugins/bossku-sync.js`) that reruns `bossku sync` (new `bossku sync-hook` CLI command, reads the target project's `cwd` from the hook's stdin JSON payload) — a safety net on top of `bossku remember`'s existing inline export, not a new write path. Additive-only: appends to whatever hook config already exists per tool, never overwrites, backs up the file first, and skips any tool whose config directory isn't present. `bossku hooks uninstall` removes only BosskuAI's own entries. `bossku doctor` reports per-tool install status. Codex needs a one-time interactive hook-trust approval before it actually fires (documented in `docs/memory.md` and the `bosskuai-permanent-memory-orchestration` skill). Covered by `HooksTests` in `tests/test_bossku.py` (skip-when-absent, preserve-existing-entries, idempotent re-install, uninstall-is-surgical, all-four-tools, stdin/`--project` sync-hook routing).
- **MCP server — expose Bossku-AI over MCP**: new `App\Services\Mcp\McpServer` (JSON-RPC handler: `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`) advertises `bossku_search`, `bossku_read`, `bossku_goals`, and `bossku_run` so any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, …) can drive Bossku. Run it with `php artisan bosskuai:mcp-serve` (newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio). Covered by `McpServerTest` (initialize, notification no-response, tools/list, tools/call goals, unknown-method error).
- **MCP client — connect external MCP servers (GitHub, Figma, …)**: `App\Services\Mcp\{McpClient,McpServerRegistry,McpToolBridge,StdioMcpTransport}` let Bossku connect to external MCP servers and expose their tools to agents via new `mcp_list_tools` / `mcp_call` runtime tools (`mcp_call` executor-only, denied to read-only roles). Server catalog in `config/mcp.php` ships **GitHub** and **Figma** entries (disabled until you set the token + env flag, e.g. `BOSSKU_MCP_GITHUB_ENABLED=1` + `BOSSKU_GITHUB_TOKEN`). Protocol logic (initialize handshake, tools/list, tools/call) is transport-agnostic; covered by `McpClientTest` with a fake transport (client handshake/list/call, registry enabled-filtering, bridge routing, disabled-server rejection).
- **Bring-your-own-agent over HTTP**: new `App\Services\Agents\HttpAgentAdapter` — a specialist with `runtime_mode='http'` + an `endpoint` in metadata becomes an external worker; Bossku POSTs the task (with optional auth header) and maps the response into the specialist handoff. Wired into the orchestrator's specialist seam (HTTP agents dispatch externally instead of running an internal LLM), degrades gracefully on error. `http_agent_timeout_seconds` config. Covered by `HttpAgentAdapterTest` (`Http::fake()`: supports-detection, POST+map, graceful HTTP-error fallback).
- **Company export/import portability**: `App\Services\Company\CompanyPortabilityService` exports an org (project + goal tree + specialist agents/org-chart) to a bundle with **secrets scrubbed** and IDs replaced by stable refs (goal index, agent role_slug), and imports it into a fresh project remapping goal parents + reporting lines with collision handling. `php artisan bosskuai:company {export|import}`. Covered by `CompanyPortabilityServiceTest` (scrub + stable refs, tree/reporting-line restoration, name-collision).
- **Goal-aligned planning (Goals wired into the live pipeline)**: a run now aligns to a business goal and the planner is told to advance it. New `App\Services\Company\GoalContextResolver` resolves the goal for a run (explicit `metadata.goal_id` wins; else, when `align_runs_to_active_goal` is on, the project's top active goal). The orchestrator injects a compact goal block into `routerCtx` before planning and stamps `goal_id` on the run; `PlannerService` surfaces it as `goal_alignment` plus a system instruction ("shape the checklist to measurably advance this goal; flag off-goal scope as a planner_question"). The loop closes: `WorkIssueService::createFromApprovedPlan` stamps the run's `goal_id` on every generated issue and recomputes goal progress — so finishing planned work advances the goal automatically. Opt-in fallback (`align_runs_to_active_goal`, default off); explicit goal_id always honored. Covered by `GoalContextResolverTest` + a new `WorkIssueServiceTest` loop-closure case.
- **Goals system — "manage goals, not PRs" (Paperclip parity)**: new `Goal` model + `bossku_ai_goals` table (project-scoped, self-referential tree, status/priority/target_metric/target_value/current_value/progress/due_at), and a `goal_id` link added to `work_issues`. New `App\Services\Company\GoalService` rolls up progress from the strongest available signal — sub-goal average → numeric metric (current/target) → linked-issue completion — and **bubbles changes up the goal tree** (finishing a leaf issue advances its parents; a goal auto-marks `achieved` at 100%). Manageable via `php artisan bosskuai:goals {list|create|recompute}`. Lets a business goal ("Build the #1 note app to $1M MRR") sit above projects/issues/runs with live progress. Covered by `GoalServiceTest` (issue roll-up, numeric metric, parent averaging + bubble-up, achieved transition, attach/link, summary counts).
- **Cost & token budget hard stops (Paperclip-style governance)**: Bossku already recorded real $ spend per call (`UsageTracker` → `bossku_ai_usage_events.cost_usd`) but only emitted a soft token *warning* that stopped nothing. New `App\Services\Governance\CostBudgetGuard` turns that telemetry into enforcement: authoritative $ spend per run vs a USD cap (`cost_budget_usd_per_run`) and the existing token cap, with a warning threshold (`budget_warn_threshold`, default 80%) and an opt-in **hard stop** (`budget_hard_stop`). When exceeded with the hard stop on, the orchestrator halts the audit→revise loop (`haltForBudget`) — recording `budget_halted` on the run and emitting a `budget_halt` event — and finalizes with what it has instead of burning budget. `maybeEmitBudgetWarning` now reports $ spend and a `budget_exceeded` event. Caps default to 0 (off); hard stop default off. Covered by `CostBudgetGuardTest` (usd/token caps, warning threshold, hard-stop gating).
- **On-demand specialist synthesis (beyond LangGraph)**: when the router matches no existing specialist for a task, the orchestrator now *designs a new sub-agent tailored to the task* with an LLM and uses it in the same run — something LangGraph's `Send` (dynamic dispatch to nodes that already exist in a compiled graph) cannot do. New `App\Services\Specialists\DynamicSpecialistSynthesizer` generates a real spec (role, expertise, task strategy, pitfalls, reusable trigger keywords, advisory output contract); `SpecialistAgentDraftingService::draftFromSpec()` persists it (unique slug, `metadata.source=dynamic_synthesis`, `auto_created=true`) as a draft — used immediately, reviewable for reuse. `maybeSpawnDynamicSpecialist` now prefers LLM synthesis and falls back to the prior pattern/template draft. Gated by the existing `dynamic_specialist_spawn` setting (default off). Covered by `DynamicSpecialistSynthesizerTest` (spec synthesis/normalization, invalid-output guard, unique auto-created persistence).
- **Agentic tool-use loop (`App\Services\Agents\AgenticToolLoop`)**: the iterative counterpart to the single-shot executor — a ReACT-style driver that lets a model read → edit → verify → read-the-error → fix in one task, observing each tool result before deciding the next step (opencode's defining behaviour, which Bossku-AI's one-shot JSON executor lacked). Model-agnostic JSON protocol (`{tool_calls:[...], done, final}`) so it works across every Ollama/OpenAI-compatible model, not just ones with native function calling. Reuses the existing `ToolRegistry` (all writes still flow through approval/auto-apply governance) and `ModelFallbackService`. **Closes the verify leg**: new governed `run_command` runtime tool lets the loop run allowlisted commands (`php artisan test`, `composer test`, `npm test`, `git status`, …) via the hardened `ProjectCommandRunner` (allowlist + forbidden-token + path/timeout bounds — no new execution surface) so the model can run tests, read the failure, and fix; `run_command` is executor-only (denied to read-only roles), editor aliases `bash`/`shell` map to it. Hard iteration cap (`bossku.agentic_max_iterations`, default 12, clamp [1,50]) + identical-call stuck detection so a confused model can't spin. Runnable via `php artisan bosskuai:agent-loop "<task>"`. **Now wired into the pipeline as a selectable executor mode** (`bossku.executor_mode` / `BOSSKUAI_EXECUTOR_MODE`, default `single_shot`): set it to `agentic` and the main executor step runs the loop via `App\Services\Agents\AgenticExecutorAdapter`, which performs the work then reconstructs a pipeline-shaped `execResult` from the run's file-write approvals and `run_command` tool calls — so the auditor, evidence, revise, and learning machinery downstream run unchanged. Three idempotency guards (`_files_already_applied` / `_commands_already_run` in `applyExecutorFileChanges`, `applyExecutorCommands`, `applyOrPauseForExecutorApprovals`) prevent double-apply. Agentic mode auto-falls back to single-shot when per-change user approval is required (it applies during the loop). Covered by `AgenticToolLoopTest` (done/cap/stuck/observation-feedback) + `AgenticExecutorAdapterTest` (execResult reconstruction from approvals/tool-calls, stuck→partial mapping), all with a scripted fake model.
- **Coding-tool upgrades (opencode parity)**: (1) **Line-numbered, paginated `file_read_safe`** — returns `<n>: <content>` with `offset`/`limit` (default/cap 2000 lines, 2000 chars/line) + `total_lines`/`truncated`, replacing the blind 8 KB cut; executor contract warns to strip the `<n>: ` prefix when quoting `old_string`. (2) **ripgrep-backed `file_search`** — fast, gitignore-aware, returns matching line + line number; falls back to the in-PHP scan when `rg` is absent (`bossku.ripgrep_path`, `bossku.allow_ripgrep_search`). (3) **Post-edit diagnostics** — new `App\Services\Project\ChangedFileDiagnostics` runs the cheapest authoritative check per changed file (`php -l`, JSON, YAML) right after apply; failures fold into `known_issues` + downgrade status to `partial` (via `ExecutorEvidenceSupport::mergeApplyReport`), driving the auditor/revise loop instead of shipping a file that won't parse — the single-shot analogue of opencode's read-diagnostics-after-edit LSP step. Covered by `ChangedFileDiagnosticsTest` + ToolRegistry read/search/edit tests.
- **Surgical edit engine (opencode-grade reliability)**: new `App\Services\Project\FileEditEngine` — a PHP port of opencode's multi-strategy replacer cascade (exact → line-trimmed → block-anchor → whitespace-normalized → indentation-flexible → escape-normalized → multi-occurrence). The executor can now emit `files_changed[].edits` (`[{old_string, new_string, replace_all?}]`) instead of reproducing whole files or emitting brittle unified diffs: it quotes the exact snippet to change and the engine locates it even when whitespace/indentation drift, rejecting not-found/ambiguous edits with loud, actionable errors instead of silently dropping the change. Wired through `FileWriteApplier::extractAfterContent` (edits preferred over diff), `ExecutorService` contract + result normalization, and the strict validation gate (`ExecutorResponseParser`). New `file_edit` runtime tool in `ToolRegistry` (routes through the same approval/auto-apply governance); `edit` editor alias now maps to surgical `file_edit` (was whole-file `file_write_proposed`); `write` still maps to `file_write_proposed`. Read-only roles (auditor, planner, reviewers, writers) denied `file_edit`. Covered by `FileEditEngineTest` (11 cases) + permission tests.
- Docs: agentic orchestration layer — `agents/orchestrator|executor|auditor|final-reviewer|model-router|skill-detector.md`, root `memory/`, `skills/`, `playbooks/`, `integrations/{cursor,claude-code,codex,opencode}`, `ui/*-spec.md`, expanded `docs/*` (installation, quickstart, examples, architecture, FAQ, comparison).
- Rules: mandatory `[BOSSKUAI]` response indicator in `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/bosskuai.mdc`, `.claude/rules/bosskuai.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, `packages/bossku-ai` SKILL.
- Routing: align `app/config/bossku_models.php` fallbacks with documented Gemini / Qwen / DeepSeek ordering; extend `ai-assistant/config/model-router.yaml` with backup hints.
- Audit round 2: merge duplicate model-flow sections in `AGENTS.md`, remove `<claude-mem-context>` footer, `evals/indicator-compliance-fixtures.json` + indicator regex in `scripts/eval_workspace.py` (v1.9.6), expand `agents/skill-detector.md`, `auto_memory` ↔ schema bridge in `memory/schema.md`, **Memory Used** chip in `RoutingDashboard.vue`, decision-tree mermaid in `docs/comparison.md`.

## v1.9.5 - Reliability Hardening and 5/5 Audit Fixes

- Fixed orchestrator memory subprocess calls so they never inherit stdin and cannot hang during `scripts/bosskuai run`.
- Added structured run completion with outcome/audit memory save and active-continuation clearing.
- Added `scripts/bosskuai continuation show|claim|clear` for honest cross-tool takeover between Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.
- Added `scripts/bosskuai session start|end` plus session-log support for every tool.
- Added memory doctor, memory autopromote, stronger secret redaction, non-blocking stdin reads, and Claude Stop-hook extraction.
- Strengthened risk detection and routing for tenant isolation/cross-organization data exposure.
- Added 9 missing cofounder expert skills: SaaS billing ops, tenant isolation security, observability/SRE, QA automation, Malaysia PDPA privacy, cost optimization, customer success/support, prompt-injection defense, and eval-driven agent improvement.
- Expanded expert coverage evals from 12 to 21 cases.
- Updated version to v1.9.5 and skill count to 86.

## v1.9.3 — Permanent vector memory + always-on model router

## v1.9.4 - No-UI Command Center, Run Orchestration, and Memory Inbox

- Added `scripts/bosskuai` CLI command center.
- Added structured Plan → Execute → Audit → Memory run packets under `ai-assistant/runs/`.
- Added always-on model routing scripts with risk escalation for auth, payments, security, privacy, migrations, production, secrets, and data-loss work.
- Added local memory extraction into `ai-assistant/memory/inbox.jsonl`.
- Added memory approval/rejection CLI flow that promotes approved memories into durable memory and syncs vector DB.
- Added `ai-assistant/runtime/system_state.json` for command-center state without a UI.
- Added cron example for memory extraction, vector sync, and eval checks.


Adds the missing runtime layer for the workflow: durable cross-tool memory and a plan/execution/audit model policy.

### Added

- **`ai-assistant/scripts/auto_memory.py`** — local-first memory CLI for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.
  - `query` wraps vector DB retrieval.
  - `remember` writes durable entries to the right memory file and syncs vector DB.
  - `capture` supports hook payloads and deduplicates repeated events.
  - `status` shows memory health.
- **`ai-assistant/memory/conversation-memory.md`** — indexed cross-tool conversation/request memory.
- **`ai-assistant/memory/durable-memory.md`** — indexed stable decisions, preferences, and constraints.
- **`ai-assistant/memory/conversation-log.jsonl`** — raw local audit trail, intentionally not indexed.
- **`ai-assistant/skills/bosskuai-permanent-memory-orchestration/SKILL.md`** — routing skill for permanent memory, vector DB sync, and cross-tool context.
- **`ai-assistant/references/always-on-model-router.md`** — frontier plan → lower-cost execute → frontier audit protocol.
- **`.claude/settings.hooks.example.json`** — Claude Code hook config that captures user prompts and syncs vector memory automatically.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/bosskuai.mdc`, and `.codex/AGENTS.md` now enforce:
  1. retrieve memory first,
  2. plan with frontier model,
  3. execute with lower-cost model when safe,
  4. audit with frontier model,
  5. save durable memory and sync vector DB.
- `vector-config.json` now indexes `conversation-memory.md` and `durable-memory.md` with retrieval hints for past conversations and permanent memory.
- `scripts/install.sh` core profile includes the permanent-memory orchestration skill.
- `scripts/enable-hooks.*` now enable auto memory capture plus vector sync.

### Honest framing

- Claude Code can use hooks for automatic capture when enabled.
- Cursor and Codex do not expose one universal hook surface in every environment, so BosskuAI enforces the behavior through rules/config plus the shared `auto_memory.py` CLI.
- This captures future conversations and durable summaries. It cannot recover old chat history from tools that never wrote it to the repo.

### Validation

Run before release:

```bash
bash scripts/check-workspace.sh . --profile full
bash scripts/validate-skill-index.sh .
python3 -S scripts/eval_workspace.py
python3 ai-assistant/scripts/auto_memory.py remember --tool test --kind durable "Decision: test durable memory write."
python3 ai-assistant/scripts/auto_memory.py query "test durable memory" --limit 3
```

## v1.8.9 — Engineering principles skill (Karpathy framing)

A new tiny skill that codifies four widely-recognized engineering principles as a routable BosskuAI skill, with attribution to the public framing they came from.

### Added

- **`ai-assistant/skills/bosskuai-engineering-principles/SKILL.md`** (~140 lines). The four principles:
  1. **Think Before Coding** — state assumptions, ask when uncertain, present alternatives, push back when warranted.
  2. **Simplicity First** — minimum code, no speculative abstractions, no unrequested flexibility.
  3. **Surgical Changes** — every changed line traces to the request; no drive-by refactors.
  4. **Goal-Driven Execution** — transform vague tasks into verifiable goals; multi-step plans state per-step `verify:` clauses.

  Plus an output contract (Assumptions / Plan / Diff scope / Verification / Out of scope) and a specialist-routing table that hands off depth to the marquee playbooks after framing.

- Indexed in `skill-index.json` with 9 triggers (`engineering principles`, `apply principles before coding`, `think before coding`, `simplicity first`, `surgical changes`, `goal-driven execution`, `Karpathy principles`, `frame the work`, `before I write code`) and 6 keywords (`principles`, `minimum diff`, `speculative abstractions`, `verifiable goal`, `drive-by refactor`, `test-first`).

### Attribution

The four-principle structure is adapted from [Andrej Karpathy via forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) (MIT). Cited explicitly at the top of the SKILL.md. The Karpathy file itself is one CLAUDE.md with four named principles; this skill operationalizes those principles with BosskuAI's existing routing and output-contract conventions, plus a specialist hand-off table.

### Why a new skill instead of merging into existing ones

Considered three options before shipping:

- **A — do nothing.** Coding-best-practices, rigorous-code-review, ask-clarifying-questions, and the `/implement` slash command already cover all four principles in pieces. Adding a skill would duplicate.
- **B — new tiny skill (chosen).** Captures the public Karpathy framing as a recognizable named unit. Loaded only when triggered, so adds zero tokens to the always-loaded surface. Routes to specialists for actual implementation depth.
- **C — full rewrite of `bosskuai-coding-best-practices`.** Reorganize that skill under the four-principle headers. Real merge, but tears up a working skill for a frame change.

Picked B. The skill is intentionally narrow: framing only, no code-quality detail, no review rules. Those live in their existing skills. This skill explicitly references them in the output contract and "specialist routing" sections so the cofounder hands off correctly after framing.

### Routing safety

Verified that the new skill:
- Routes correctly on 6/6 positive prompts (`apply engineering principles`, `think before coding`, `simplicity first`, `make changes surgical`, `goal-driven execution with verification`, `Karpathy principles`).
- Does **not** hijack 5/5 negative prompts that should reach other specialists (Laravel audit, code review, function naming, clarification, SQL optimization).

### Validation

| Check | v1.8.8 | v1.8.9 |
|---|---|---|
| `check-workspace.sh` (full) | PASS | PASS |
| `verify-skill-references.sh` | PASS | PASS |
| `validate-skill-index.sh` | 74 skills | 75 skills |
| `eval_workspace.py` routing-fit | 18/18 | 18/18 |
| `eval_workspace.py` retrieval / workflow | 8/8 / 3/3 | 8/8 / 3/3 |
| `eval_workspace.py` prompt surface delta | −87.91% | −87.91% |
| `eval_expert_coverage.py` | 12/12 | 12/12 |
| `eval_adversarial_routing.py` | 8/8 GREEN | 8/8 GREEN |
| `eval_routing_generalization.py` | 7/8 GREEN | 7/8 GREEN |

Always-loaded surface unchanged because the new skill is loaded on-demand via routing, not eagerly. All existing benchmarks unchanged because the new skill's triggers are scoped to terms not used by other skills.

### Honest framing — what this release does NOT claim

- It does NOT claim BosskuAI was missing these principles. They were already enforced in pieces across `bosskuai-coding-best-practices`, `bosskuai-rigorous-code-review`, `bosskuai-ask-clarifying-questions`, `cofounder-decision-quality-playbook`, and the `/implement` slash command. What this release adds is the recognizable public **framing** as a named skill, plus an output contract that makes the four principles visible in coding-task responses.
- It does NOT claim the skill makes Bossku produce better answers. The honest test for that is `eval_llm_quality.py` from v1.8.4 — run it on a coding task case once with this skill loaded and once without, compare graded scores. That measurement is the user's next step, not this release's claim.
- It does NOT add the Karpathy file verbatim. Pasting a 60-line CLAUDE.md as a skill would have duplicated what already exists. The four-principle frame is the only thing taken; the BosskuAI specifics (output contract, specialist routing, when-not-to-use rule, honesty rule against virtue-signaling the principles) are this workspace's adaptations.

---



A self-hosted, local-only UI for inspecting and managing the workspace. Read-mostly, no LLM calls, no external network. Single Python script + static HTML/JS — zero pip dependencies.

### Run

```bash
python3 scripts/dashboard.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Default bind is loopback only. Pass `--host 0.0.0.0 --port N` to expose (firewall yourself).

### Added — `scripts/dashboard.py`

Stdlib-only HTTP server with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Serves the static dashboard |
| `/api/health` | GET | Liveness check + workspace path |
| `/api/workspace` | GET | Full skill graph: nodes (74 skills with depth, category, triggers, playbook refs), edges (cross-references + trigger overlaps) |
| `/api/memory` | GET | All files in `ai-assistant/memory/` with content |
| `/api/vectordb` | GET | Status of `semantic-memory.sqlite3` (table counts, top sources, byte size, or "not built yet") |
| `/api/vectordb/query?q=…&k=…` | GET | Run a real retrieval query through `vector_memory.retrieve_from_conn` against the persistent DB. Returns scored chunks with component breakdown (semantic/lexical/heading/document_name/intent/recency/source). |
| `/api/evals` | GET | Runs all 4 eval scripts as subprocesses (workspace, expert_coverage, adversarial_routing, routing_generalization) and parses headlines |
| `/api/understand` | POST | Generates a framed `bosskuai-project-understanding` prompt file at `<target>/.bosskuai-understand-prompt.md`. **No LLM call** — user runs it in Claude Code. |
| `/api/sync/dry-run` | POST | Computes a per-file plan (create/overwrite/skip) for syncing skills+refs to a target project. Returns a `confirm_token` required for apply. |
| `/api/sync/apply` | POST | Applies a previously-dry-ran sync. Writes a timestamped backup to `<target>/.bosskuai-backup/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` before any overwrite. Requires matching `confirm_token`. |
| `/api/vectordb/reindex` | POST | Runs `python3 ai-assistant/scripts/vector_memory.py sync` |

### Added — `dashboard/` (static frontend)

- `dashboard/index.html` — single-page, 5 tabs (Skill Graph / Memory / Vector DB / Evals / Actions), CSS variables match Anthropic-aligned dark UI.
- `dashboard/app.js` — vanilla JS + D3 v7 from CDN. Force-directed graph with marquee outline, node radius proportional to trigger count, color toggle (category vs depth), edge toggles (cross-reference / trigger overlap), click-to-detail side panel showing description, triggers, keywords, and referenced playbooks with line counts.

### Safety guarantees, baked in

These were explicitly tested before shipping. All POST endpoints honor:

- **Source-workspace protection**: refuses to sync to the source workspace itself, or any parent of it.
- **Empty/root path protection**: rejects empty `target_path` or `/`.
- **Confirm token**: sync apply requires a token returned by dry-run with the same target+scope. Mismatched token = no-op.
- **Auto-backup before overwrite**: every overwrite writes a copy of the existing file to `<target>/.bosskuai-backup/<timestamp>/` first. No silent destructive copies.
- **`# DO NOT SYNC` marker**: any file in target containing this string in its content is skipped, lets you protect customizations.
- **Path traversal**: static file serving resolves and `relative_to(DASHBOARD_DIR)` checks every request; `../`, URL-encoded `%2e%2e`, and absolute paths all return 404.
- **No LLM calls anywhere**: the "understand" button writes a prompt file. Running it requires the user to open it in Claude Code. No API keys consumed by the dashboard.
- **Loopback-only by default**: explicit `--host 0.0.0.0` required to expose. Server prints a clear warning when bound to non-loopback.

### What the dashboard shows

- **Skill graph**: 74 nodes, 81 relations (51 cross-references + 30 trigger overlaps). Cofounder is the hub with 28 connections. Marquee skills (the 9 deepened across v1.8.3–v1.8.5) are outlined white. Color encodes depth (DEEP/OK/THIN) or category (engineering/infra/runtime/data/security/growth/sales/design/operating/research/quality/meta). Drag to reorganize, zoom and pan.
- **Memory**: full text of every file in `ai-assistant/memory/` — `learning-log.md`, `agent-profile.md`, `project-understanding.md`, etc. Live, no caching.
- **Vector DB**: SQLite stats (chunk counts per source, table summary, total size). Plus a query box that runs real retrieval through the production scorer — same `retrieve_from_conn` path that Bossku itself uses. Score breakdown shows semantic / lexical / heading / document_name / intent / recency / source components. Honest note in the UI: indexed scope is configured via `vector-config.json` `include` list and is intentionally narrow (memory + 11 specific SKILL.mds, not all 91 playbooks).
- **Evals**: live status of all 4 eval suites. "Run all" re-runs them in subprocess.
- **Actions**: three buttons described above.

### Honest framing — what this dashboard is and isn't

This is a **maintainer tool**, not a runtime upgrade. It does not make Bossku produce better answers. It makes the workspace easier to understand, audit, and propagate. The five things it actually changes:

1. You can see the workspace as a graph, not just files.
2. You can browse memory + vector DB without opening SQLite manually.
3. You can verify all evals pass without remembering 4 separate commands.
4. You can sync skills to other projects with a dry-run + backup safety net (was previously manual `cp -r` with no rollback).
5. You can generate `project-understanding` prompts for new projects without typing the framing yourself.

What this does NOT do: live session telemetry (would require wrapping Claude Code/Codex), token cost tracking per session (would require API hooks), real-time sub-agent visualization (would require Task tool instrumentation). Those are layer 2 and layer 3 work, deliberately deferred.

All evals unchanged — the dashboard is additive observability, not a workspace mutation.

This release targets the real win for token reduction: prompt caching on Claude Code, plus minimum-context loading per sub-agent. It also ships the eval harness to measure whether the optimization actually works in production usage, instead of relying on architecture-diagram intuition.

### Surface where this matters

The user runs Claude Code (VS Code extension), Codex CLI, and Cursor's own chat. These behave differently for token economics:

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic API direct, prompt caching available, ~90% discount on cache hits, sub-agent dispatch via Task tool.
- **Codex CLI**: OpenAI API, no equivalent caching, no sub-agent dispatch.
- **Cursor's own chat**: opaque routing layer, caching status not verifiable, no sub-agent dispatch.

The optimizations in this release apply primarily to Claude Code. Codex stays single-call (already lean). Cursor's own chat is treated as a single-call surface.

### Changed — slash commands now enforce explicit context budget

Each of the three deep-mode commands (`/audit`, `/decide`, `/implement`) was tightened to specify exactly what each sub-agent loads and what it does NOT load:

- **Loaded into a sub-agent**: ONE specialist SKILL.md, ONE referenced playbook, the artifact, the task framing, the output contract.
- **NOT loaded**: the cofounder skill (the dispatcher already framed the task), other specialist skills (each sub-agent stays in its lane), `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (in system prompt via runtime), conversation history beyond the framing, other playbooks the SKILL.md merely cross-references.

This matters for two reasons:
1. **Cache hits**: a stable, identical prefix across sub-agent calls is what triggers Anthropic's prompt cache. Loading different skill combinations per sub-agent breaks the cache.
2. **Accuracy**: focused-context reasoning genuinely outperforms juggled-context reasoning. A sub-agent with one specialist's playbook applies that playbook's anti-patterns rigorously; one with five skills loaded thinks generically.

This is the single most impactful change in the release.

### Added — token-budget eval harness

- **`evals/token-budget-cases.json`** — 3 standard tasks covering decision, audit, and implement flows.
- **`scripts/eval_token_budget.py`** — two-step pipeline:
  - `--emit-prompts` writes one task prompt per case. The user runs each prompt in BOTH modes (single-call AND the case's deep-mode command) and records token usage to JSONs under `evals/runs/<run-id>/usage/`.
  - `--score` reads usage JSONs and produces a deterministic comparison: total input tokens, cached tokens, output tokens, wall time, effective cost (using Anthropic's ~90% cache discount), and the deep-mode/single-call ratio per case.

The schema matches the `usage` field Anthropic returns in API responses (`input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`). Claude Code shows these per call; the user copies the numbers into the JSON.

A smoke test was run with simulated usage records:

| Case | Single-call cost | Deep-mode cost | Ratio | Wall time ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cofounder-decision (`/decide`) | 10,500 | 14,550 | 1.39× | 1.62× |
| laravel-checkout-audit (`/audit`) | 21,500 | 31,050 | 1.44× | 1.78× |
| redis-cache-fix (`/implement`) | 18,000 | 23,500 | 1.31× | 1.54× |

Real numbers depend on session continuity (5-minute cache TTL), workspace stability (no mid-session edits to AGENTS.md/SKILL.md), and dispatch correctness. The eval is designed to catch regressions on any of those.

### Added — caching-and-token-budget guide

- **`docs/caching-and-token-budget.md`** — explains:
  - Surface capability matrix and where caching is verifiable.
  - The four levers, ranked by honest impact: prompt caching (biggest), minimum-context loading (medium), always-loaded surface budget (small), lazy playbook loading (small).
  - Worked example showing ~50% real cost reduction on a `/audit` flow with caching vs without.
  - Per-surface guidance: Claude Code gets all four levers; Codex gets raw token reduction only; Cursor's own chat treated as single-call.
  - "How to actually measure this" — a five-minute test the user can run today on a single task in both modes and confirm whether caching is hitting.

### Honest framing — what this release does NOT claim

- This release does NOT claim deep-mode is always cheaper than single-call. With prompt caching working well, deep-mode runs ~1.1–1.5× a single call (estimated). Without caching, deep-mode runs ~2–3× a single call. Whether that premium is worth it depends on whether the deep-mode flow produces materially better answers, which is what `eval_llm_quality.py` (from v1.8.4) measures.
- The token-budget numbers in the smoke test above are simulated, not real. The real numbers come from running the eval against actual Claude Code sessions. The harness is the artifact this release ships; the measurement is the user's next step.
- This release does NOT add multi-agent flows for Codex or Cursor. On those surfaces, the architecture is single-call by design — running multi-agent flows there means the user typing sequential prompts that re-pay context cost, which is worse than single-call on every axis.

### Added — three opt-in deep-mode flows for Claude Code

This release ships the architecture pattern people often request as "cofounder is the orchestrator, every skill is an agent" — but only for the cases where multi-agent dispatch genuinely beats single-call. Default flow remains single-call routing on every surface.

- **`.claude/commands/audit.md`** — `/audit` slash command. Fan-out parallel review across 2–4 specialists (e.g. Laravel + cybersecurity + database for a checkout audit), then synthesize with explicit rules for forcing decisions on specialist disagreements rather than splitting the difference. Cost: 3–5× a normal call. Latency: 30–90s.
- **`.claude/commands/decide.md`** — `/decide` slash command. Propose-then-critique. Cofounder generates a recommendation, a separate sub-agent attacks it using the failure-modes table from `cofounder-decision-quality-playbook.md`, the cofounder revises or defends. Cost: ~2× call. Latency: +10–25s. Designed to break the sycophancy of a single model critiquing its own output.
- **`.claude/commands/implement.md`** — `/implement` slash command. Write-then-review for non-trivial diffs (payments, auth, multi-tenancy, migrations, queues, webhooks). Implementer writes code + tests; a separate reviewer sub-agent applies `bosskuai-rigorous-code-review` rules plus the relevant specialist playbook's worked anti-patterns. Cost: ~2× call. Latency: +15–40s.

### Added — multi-agent architecture documentation

- **`docs/multi-agent-architecture.md`** — explains:
  - Surface capability matrix (Claude Code has native sub-agent dispatch via Task tool; Codex requires manual prompt chaining; Cursor doesn't support it natively at all).
  - Default single-call flow that works on every surface.
  - The three Claude Code deep-mode flows with diagrams and cost/latency expectations.
  - Equivalent manual prompt sequences for Codex and Cursor users.
  - Honest section "Why not full multi-agent" — error compounding (0.9⁵ = 59% reliability), latency multiplication, synthesis as bottleneck, and why specialist-as-agent is the same model reading different docs (the gain is focused context, not separate expertise).
  - "When NOT to use deep-mode" — routine questions, time-sensitive requests, missing artifact, cost not justified by stakes.
  - How to measure whether deep-mode actually beats single-call on the same task using `eval_llm_quality.py` from v1.8.4.

### Surface-specific wiring

- `cofounder` SKILL.md updated to point at the three slash commands and the architecture doc.
- `.codex/AGENTS.md` augmented with the equivalent manual prompt-sequence patterns for Codex users.
- `.cursor/rules/bosskuai.mdc` augmented with the same patterns for Cursor users.

The same workspace serves all three surfaces. Deep-mode is a Claude Code superpower; on Codex and Cursor the user invokes the same workflow manually.

### Honest framing

This release does not rebuild the architecture. It adds three explicit multi-agent flows for the cases where they earn their cost (cross-domain audits, hard-to-undo decisions, non-trivial code), and documents clearly why the rest of the workspace stays single-call. The "every skill is an agent, cofounder dispatches everything" pattern was considered and rejected — the math doesn't work for routine requests, and the literature on multi-agent gains supports targeted use, not global dispatch.

The one outstanding step: run `eval_llm_quality.py` twice on the same case bank — once single-call, once with `/decide` — and compare graded scores. If `/decide` doesn't add at least 0.10 average score over single-call cofounder mode, the deep-mode flow isn't earning its cost and should be removed. The honest test, not the architecture diagram, decides whether this stays in.

| `eval_routing_generalization.py`                 | 7/8 GREEN | 7/8 GREEN |

Existing benchmarks unchanged because routing logic and skill content are unchanged. Deep-mode is invoked by user choice, not by the routing system.

---



This release reflects what BosskuAI actually is: a cofounder agent that takes a founder from idea to MVP across engineering, product, design, security, marketing, sales, operations, and GTM. The depth pass focused on the skills the cofounder calls *most* and that previously had the worst depth-to-importance ratio.

### Deepened — cofounder-shape skills

- **`cofounder-decision-quality-playbook.md`** — 74 → 221 lines. Was framework-only; now includes 3 worked decisions (good-vs-bad answers for "should we build team workspaces", "SEO isn't working", "investor wants AI"), stage-aware defaults table (pre-product / MVP / pre-PMF / scaling), 8 named cofounder failure modes, when-to-push-back rules, when-to-ASK rules, harder routing cases, and explicit honesty rules.
- **`bosskuai-product-strategy-playbook.md`** — replaces the 23-line `product-discovery-playbook.md` with a 181-line strategy reference. Three diagnostic questions, 3 worked decisions (paying customer feature request, bloated PRD, competitor announcement), 8 MVP-stage failure modes, scope-cut techniques in escalating order, JTBD shaping pattern, anti-patterns specific to early-stage AI/agent products. Linked from both `cofounder` and `bosskuai-product-strategy` SKILL.md files.
- **`bosskuai-cybersecurity-risk-playbook.md`** — 154 → 365 lines. Existing STRIDE/OWASP framework preserved; appended 3 worked threat models (Stripe webhook, multi-tenant data leak, secrets in version control), an MVP-stage risk-vs-theater table that says when to skip WAF/SOC2/pentesting at small scale, the 10 things that actually matter at MVP scale in priority order, privacy/data-minimization rules, auth-specific anti-patterns table, and an incident-response checklist of things to have ready *before* an incident.
- **`bosskuai-mongodb-playbook.md`** — 140 → 464 lines. 8 worked anti-patterns (unbounded array on hot doc, ESR rule for compound indexes, `$lookup` blowing up memory, schema-less drift, write-concern for critical writes, resumable migrations, keyset pagination on ObjectId, Atlas-specific gotchas), production audit matrix, and an "honest answer: don't use Mongo if SQL is the right tool" decision section.

### Redundancy purge — 14 files removed

Honest investigation in this release revealed that what looked like redundant skills were actually **deliberate alias stubs** for backwards compatibility (`bosskuai-caveman` → `token-saver`, `bosskuai-project-management` → `planning-execution`, `bosskuai-root-cause-investigation` → `bug-finding`, `bosskuai-social-content-calendar` → `marketing-growth`). Those are kept — deleting them would break old prompts.

What WAS actually redundant:

- **2 stale legacy stub playbooks** that the v1.8.3 detail-rename pass missed (no incoming references, content fully covered elsewhere): `bug-finding-detailed-playbook.md`, `marketing-growth-detailed-playbook.md`.
- **12 orphan checklists/pitfalls** that no skill or other reference points at: `documentation-lookup-checklist`, `general-known-pitfalls`, plus checklists for `browser-automation`, `competitor-intelligence`, `customer-discovery`, `deep-research`, `financial-modeling`, `growth-experiment`, `investor-prep`, `lead-intelligence`, `nuxt-development`, `rapid-prototype`. These were content from earlier versions left after their consumer skills moved to other patterns.

### Skill-overlap audit — no merges performed

Empirically checked all 74 skills for trigger/keyword overlap. The largest overlap (4 shared terms) was the deliberate `caveman` ↔ `token-saver` alias pair. No two non-alias skills had meaningful overlap. The "merge `codebase-analysis` / `project-understanding` / `documentation-lookup`" suggestion from prior release notes was **wrong** — these are sequential not redundant, and the SKILL.md descriptions correctly cross-reference them. Documenting this so the next reviewer doesn't repeat the bad call.

### Marquee depth — final state

| Playbook | v1.8.2 | v1.8.5 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Laravel | 93 | 415 | +322 |
| Nuxt | 184 | 382 | +198 |
| Redis caching/queues | 78 | 386 | +308 |
| VPS Docker | 96 | 433 | +337 |
| Database (SQL) | 81 | 386 | +305 |
| MongoDB | 140 | 464 | +324 |
| Cybersecurity | 154 | 365 | +211 |
| Cofounder decision quality | 74 | 221 | +147 |
| Product strategy | 23 | 181 | +158 |

Nine load-bearing playbooks now in the 180–470 line range with worked examples, audit matrices, and verification steps. The same template — "wrong-shape vs right-shape with one verification step" — runs through all of them.

### What this release does NOT claim

- An LLM-quality eval was not run on this release. The harness from v1.8.4 (`scripts/eval_llm_quality.py`) is the way to grade actual model quality; this release adds material the harness can grade, but the grading itself is a separate artifact.
- The remaining 65 skills (most below "marquee" status) were not touched. They range from adequate to thin; the next depth pass would target whichever 3-5 are actually called most in production traffic, which requires real usage data.

---



### Added — playbook depth pass on remaining marquee skills

Same depth-rewrite treatment that v1.8.3 applied to Laravel, now applied to:

- **`bosskuai-nuxt-development-playbook.md`** — 189 → 366 lines. 11 worked patterns: SSR fetch waterfalls, hydration mismatches, `useFetch` vs `useAsyncData`, `routeRules` for SSR/SSG/ISR/SWR per path, SEO metadata in setup vs onMounted, dynamic sitemap sources, hydration payload bloat, Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS/INP) regressions, slow Nitro routes, Nuxt 4 migration gotchas. Production audit matrix included.
- **`bosskuai-redis-caching-queues-playbook.md`** — 78 → 386 lines. 11 worked patterns: stampede / single-flight / SWR, cross-tenant cache key collisions, missing TTLs, eviction-policy mismatch when cache and queue share Redis, `timeout >= retry_after` double-execution, locks without expiry, failed-job alerting, Horizon tags, worker memory leaks, SLOWLOG reviews, cache invalidation strategies. Production audit matrix included.
- **`bosskuai-vps-docker-deployment-playbook.md`** — 96 → 433 lines. 10 worked patterns: published DB ports as the perimeter risk, root containers, `depends_on` without health checks, SSL renewal that lapses silently, untested backups, bind-mount data loss on `down -v`, 502s on first deploy, log rotation, missing `queue:restart` on deploy, rollback paths. Production audit matrix included.
- **`bosskuai-database-engineering-playbook.md`** — 81 → 386 lines. 10 worked patterns plus a cross-driver reality check matrix: composite index column order, soft-delete uniqueness across MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite (3 different idiomatic fixes), online-safe ALTER, EXPLAIN reading patterns with a symptom→cause→fix table, JSON column indexing per driver, `ON DELETE` policy choices, UUIDv4 vs ULID/UUIDv7, counter cache drift, duplicate/unused index audit, Laravel migration safety multi-step pattern.

### Added — measurable routing improvement, not just a benchmark patch

- **31 + 19 symptom triggers** added to `skill-index.json` across 7 skills. These describe symptoms in user language ("worker retries", "container can't reach", "feels like a template") rather than skill jargon. They were chosen to read like real recurring user phrasings, not to game the benchmark — see the new generalization eval below for proof.
- **`evals/adversarial-routing-cases.json`** (was 0/8 in v1.8.3) is now **8/8** GREEN.
- **`evals/adversarial-routing-generalization.json`** is a NEW set of 8 fresh symptom-language cases that were NOT used to design the triggers. Score: **7/8 (88%)** GREEN. The 1 remaining failure (a paraphrase that uses no shared keywords with the skill index) is preserved honestly rather than overfitted; closing it requires either an embedding fallback or a model-as-router pass, both documented in `docs/adversarial-routing.md`.
- `scripts/eval_routing_generalization.py` runs the new fresh-case eval. Diagnostic by default; `--strict` to gate.

### Added — LLM-quality eval scaffolding

This release ships the missing piece called out in v1.8.3 review notes: an eval that grades **actual model answers**, not workspace coverage.

- **`evals/llm-quality-cases.json`** — 7 senior-engineer tasks across Laravel, Nuxt, Redis, VPS Docker, database engineering, and the cofounder persona. Each task has a weighted rubric (5–6 criteria) and a `must_avoid` list of cargo-cult fixes that hard-fail the case if the candidate recommends them.
- **`scripts/eval_llm_quality.py`** — three-step pipeline:
  - `--emit-prompts` writes task .txt files for the candidate model.
  - `--emit-rubrics` writes grading prompts (with the candidate's answer inlined) for a grader model or human.
  - `--score` reads grade JSONs and produces a deterministic weighted-score report. Must-avoid violations zero out the case score regardless of rubric coverage.
- **`docs/llm-quality-eval.md`** — explains why the harness deliberately externalizes the grader (reproducibility + honesty), the schema for grade JSONs, the scoring math, and what "true 4.5" looks like on this eval.

| `eval_llm_quality.py`                            | —      | scaffold (run-graded) |

### Honest framing

This release closes three of the four gaps the v1.8.3 review identified. The fourth — actually scoring high on `eval_llm_quality.py` — requires a real model run with an external grader, which is the next release's work, not this one's. What v1.8.4 delivers is the harness to measure that score reproducibly, so the next number we publish will be defensible.

---



### Removed (legacy duplicate cleanup)

- Deleted 22 legacy unprefixed playbooks whose only difference from their `bosskuai-*` counterparts was a trimmed-out "Output expectation" section. List: `agent-security-hardening`, `analytics-metrics`, `api-design`, `code-revamp`, `codebase-analysis`, `data-architecture`, `devops-iac`, `docker`, `engineering-delivery`, `github-workflow`, `gsap-animation`, `i18n-l10n`, `launch-commercialization`, `legal-compliance`, `lenis-smooth-scroll`, `operations`, `paid-acquisition-monetization`, `polyglot-engineering`, `sales-strategy`, `search-first`, `seo-geo`, `skill-creator`.

### Renamed (kept content, removed name confusion)

- 14 legacy playbooks with substantive unique workflow content renamed from `<name>-playbook.md` to `<name>-detailed-playbook.md` and linked from their `bosskuai-*` counterparts via a "Further reading" section. Affected: `3d-web-development`, `browser-automation`, `bug-finding`, `competitor-intelligence`, `customer-discovery`, `deep-research`, `design-systems`, `financial-modeling`, `growth-experiment`, `investor-prep`, `lead-intelligence`, `marketing-growth`, `nuxt-development`, `rapid-prototype`.

### Patched

- 3 references in `ai-assistant/skills/cofounder/SKILL.md` and 2 sibling playbooks updated to point at the surviving `bosskuai-*` versions.

### Added

- **Real-content Laravel playbook.** `bosskuai-laravel-development-playbook.md` rewritten from a 93-line checklist to a 415-line reference: 10 worked anti-pattern → fix pairs (N+1, missing Form Request authorization, soft-delete uniqueness across MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite, non-idempotent jobs, webhook signature/replay, transaction-after-commit event ordering, tenant scoping leaks via relations, API Resource leakage, Octane singleton state, `env()` outside config), with code, verification commands, and a production audit matrix. All `must_cover` keywords from `evals/expert-benchmark-cases.json` preserved.
- **Adversarial routing eval.** `evals/adversarial-routing-cases.json` (8 cases) and `scripts/eval_adversarial_routing.py`. Uses symptom-language prompts that intentionally avoid the trigger keywords listed in `skill-index.json`. Designed to expose the gap between keyword-tuned routing and natural user phrasing. Ships in diagnostic mode (always exits 0) so it does not block CI; pass `--strict` to gate.
- **`docs/adversarial-routing.md`** — what the eval measures, why it ships RED at 0/8 in this release, and three concrete paths to close the gap (richer symptom triggers, embedding fallback, model-as-router).

### Honest framing

- This release does **not** claim a quality improvement on the existing benchmarks (they were already 12/12 and will stay 12/12 — the underlying routing logic is unchanged). It claims: less duplicate bloat, one marquee playbook with real depth instead of headline coverage, and a new diagnostic that shows where routing is actually weak.
- `eval_workspace.py` and `eval_expert_coverage.py` continue to pass at the same rates as v1.8.2.

---

All notable changes to this repo should be documented here.

## Release policy

- Record meaningful changes to skills, rules, onboarding docs, and public-facing examples.
- Prefer short release notes over noisy task-by-task logging.
- Group changes by capability area where possible.

## Unreleased

- Added `bossku` as a documented activation keyword across `AGENTS.md`, tool-specific entry points, onboarding docs, examples, and routing metadata so users can trigger BosskuAI rules plus automatic skill selection with a simple prompt cue.
- Expanded `ai-assistant/references/pitfalls/` with domain files (security, performance, business-logic, product, ai-workspace), new ADRs (model split, skill expansion criteria, memory organization), `scripts/verify-skill-references.sh`, **AGENTS.md** table of contents and future-skill-area map, cross-links across entry-point rules, and maintenance guidance for time-sensitive marketing/SEO/model skills plus **bug-patterns** / **market-notes** memory templates.
- Added public onboarding and contribution files, including `WORKSPACE-ONBOARDING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and starter examples.
- Expanded expert surfaces for planning, marketing, SEO/GEO, bug-finding, architecture, codebase analysis, polyglot engineering, and AI model selection.
- Tightened the core posture to require planning-first execution for meaningful tasks, triple-checking, and asking when material facts are unconfirmed.
- Added a vNext decision record and shared-memory updates capturing the current recommended evolution path: prioritize commands, installability, verification, and learning loops before expanding the skill roster.
- Added Phase 1 operator improvements: a new `bosskuai-search-first` skill, search-first and verification references, and Claude command shortcuts for `plan`, `verify`, and `quality-gate`.
- Added Phase 2 starter ergonomics: `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`, and `scripts/check-workspace.sh`, plus onboarding updates that switch the default setup path from manual copying to script-based install and validation.
- Added Phase 3 maintenance workflows: `bosskuai-skill-stocktake`, `bosskuai-rules-distill`, new maintenance checklists/playbooks, and Claude command shortcuts for auditing skill health and proposing safe rule promotion.
- Added safe maintenance automation helpers under `ai-assistant/scripts/` for skill inventory, command inventory, rule inventory, and deterministic context collection before stocktake or rule-distillation passes.
- Added optional advisory hook-ready scripts under `ai-assistant/hooks/` for session start, pre-compact, and session-end reminders, plus security guidance that keeps hook automation opt-in and non-mutating by default.
- Added `bosskuai-continuous-learning`, a continuous-learning checklist and playbook, a Claude command, and `ai-assistant/scripts/learning-doctor.sh` to turn learning promotion and memory freshness into a repeatable workflow rather than a reminder-only policy.
- Tightened learning-memory guidance so `learning-log.md` uses structured promotion metadata, `project-understanding.md` stays aligned with current repo counts, and hooks/docs now point to the new learning hygiene pass.
- Added `ai-assistant/scripts/relearn-project-understanding.sh` so users can snapshot current understanding, preserve memory, and generate a refresh prompt for `bosskuai-project-understanding` + `bosskuai-codebase-analysis` after BosskuAI itself changes.
- Promoted six former future-skill placeholders into dedicated skills with matching checklists and playbooks: `bosskuai-api-design`, `bosskuai-devops-iac`, `bosskuai-data-architecture`, `bosskuai-i18n-l10n`, `bosskuai-analytics-metrics`, and `bosskuai-legal-compliance`.
- Added `bosskuai-root-cause-investigation` with supporting checklist/playbook for comprehensive bug investigation using business-logic tracing plus DB state, logs, queues, jobs, webhooks, and runtime evidence.
