# Third-party skill packs

BosskuAI vendors Agent Skills from these open-source upstream projects. Provenance is tracked in [`skills/vendored.json`](../skills/vendored.json).

`markitdown` is a thin Bossku-authored skill that documents the upstream CLI; the Microsoft package is not bundled.

`graphify` upstream no longer keeps a static `SKILL.md` in its repo: the skill is rendered per host by `graphify install`. BosskuAI vendors the cross-framework Agent-Skills variant (`graphify/graphify/skill-agents.md`) plus its `skills/agents/references/` sidecar. Re-vendor from those two paths, not from a `skills/` folder.

`ecc` is a curated subset (10 of ~280 skills) chosen to fill gaps in the Bossku library - MySQL/MariaDB, migrations, error handling, MCP servers, Playwright, WCAG 2.2, ADRs, Vue 3, Python, pytest. Each is a single self-contained `SKILL.md` with no ECC-only tooling references; the many agent-stack ECC skills were already ported earlier as `bosskuai-*` skills.

`graft` vendors the upstream `SKILL.md` body verbatim; the CLI itself is not bundled (`npm install -g @nanonets/graft`, then `graft build` per repo). One local deviation: the frontmatter `description` was rewritten to state the `graft/`-index precondition, because upstream ships inside an already-indexed repo and asserts it flatly. Re-apply that edit on the next re-vendor.

`dcg` is a thin Bossku skill that documents the upstream Destructive Command Guard CLI/hooks; the Rust binary is not bundled. Upstream license is MIT **with an OpenAI/Anthropic rider** — read the upstream `LICENSE` before redistributing the binary or derivative works.

`antislop` vendors the upstream six-skill suite unchanged. Bossku adds routing metadata in its generated index rather than rewriting the vendored skill text.

`hallmark` moved from the recorded `togethercomputer/hallmark` (now 404) to `Nutlope/hallmark`; the vendored `SKILL.md` matches it apart from line endings. Its 21-theme catalog lives in upstream `site/css/tokens.css`, vendored at `site/css/tokens.css` because every hallmark link resolves `../../site/css/tokens.css`; `bossku install` copies `site/` next to the installed skills for the same reason.

`greptile` is not a vendored pack: `bosskuai-greptile-review-loop` and `bosskuai-pr-check` are first-party adaptations of `greptileai/skills`, kept under the upstream MIT notice above. Local deviations to re-apply on any resync: `git add` scoped to the files changed for the comments, a test and lint gate plus one ask before the first push, only Greptile-bot threads resolved without a code change (never a human reviewer's), bounded polling loops, paginated inline comments, and no `p4 review` commands (they do not list or mark reviews).

Deliberately not vendored (recorded under `excluded` in `skills/vendored.json` so a re-vendor leaves them out): `taste-skill-v1`, `gpt-tasteskill`, and `stitch-skill` from the taste-skill pack. `x402` stays vendored with browser-use but `bossku install` never copies it: it prints generated wallet keys and auto-tops-up spend.

`opendataloader-pdf` vendors the complete upstream `skills/odl-pdf/` bundle unchanged. Its maintenance-only sibling is intentionally excluded, and the optional OpenDataLoader runtime is not installed automatically.

## Benchmark data

The coding benchmark uses the public [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) problem set (MIT, Copyright (c) OpenAI) from `benchmarks/datasets/HumanEval.jsonl.gz` (sha256 `b796127e635a67f93fb35c04f4cb03cf06f38c8072ee7cee8833d7bee06979ef`, 164 problems). The hidden-test tasks in `benchmarks/tasks/` were written for this repository.

## Review cadence

Models improve faster than vendored prompt text does, so packs are reviewed on a
rolling window rather than only when something breaks. `skills/vendored.json` records
`provenance.<pack>.last_synced` and a shared `review_days` (default 180).

```bash
python -m bossku skills stocktake            # age every pack against the window
python -m bossku skills stocktake --strict   # exit 1 when a pack is overdue (CI)
```

`bossku validate` prints a warning for overdue packs but stays green - a pack going
stale is a prompt to review, not a broken repo. Missing provenance *is* a hard error.

To refresh a pack: re-copy from upstream, re-run `bossku skills index`, then set
`last_synced` to today in `skills/vendored.json`.

These dates are recorded syncs, not a live upstream check - the tool reports that a
pack is due for review, never that upstream actually changed.
