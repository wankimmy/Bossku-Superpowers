# Skills

Canonical skills live in [`skills/`](../skills/). Each folder contains `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter. Write descriptions so agents can self-select: lead with **Use when…** and concrete user triggers (CI failure, release notes, cofounder mode, etc.).

## Routing

- Say `bossku` or use cofounder mode for cross-domain work.
- `bossku skills find "<task>"` chooses a primary skill and useful complements. `selection` explains selected and deferred skills, weak confidence, and missing named skills. Read descriptions and check host capabilities before loading. `matches` remains a ranked search list.
- Mixed asks are scored by concern as well as the whole prompt. Explicit skill ids and aliases take priority; negated requests, incompatible alternatives, user-only slash commands, and unavailable skills are deferred. Ordinary words such as “schema” do not count as named requests without invocation context.
- The CLI uses the installed profile by default. Use `--profile lean|core|full` to override it, or pass an actual host inventory to the Python `select_skill_stack(..., available=...)` API. A profile check cannot prove that a running host exposes every installed skill; inspect its live inventory. Optional runtimes remain capability checks in the selected skill.
- Selection is a lexical heuristic, not a probability or a runtime command. Re-route when the task changes. Tests and the [routing benchmark](benchmarks/README.md) cover a recorded regression corpus; they do not guarantee every future prompt or prove coding quality.
- `bossku skills audit` measures always-loaded description size, long skill bodies, provenance grouping, and broken relative references.
- Deprecated Bossku names resolve via [`skills/aliases.json`](../skills/aliases.json).
- Vendored third-party skills are listed in [`skills/vendored.json`](../skills/vendored.json).

## Profiles

`bossku install --profile lean` (the default) lists about 25 everyday skills with short descriptions and installs the other ~210 whole in `~/.bosskuai/library`. The agent reaches them through [`bosskuai-skill-finder`](../skills/bosskuai-skill-finder/SKILL.md): `bossku skills find "<task>"` names the skills and `bossku skills show <id>` prints one. The list lives in [`skills/lean.json`](../skills/lean.json); `bossku validate` keeps it small and complete.

`bossku install --profile core` installs Bossku co-founder essentials plus the **loop-engineering** pack (12 loop/triage/CI/PR skills) and `bosskuai-grounding`. Always-on loop discipline is in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#loop-engineering-always-on); always-on grounding is in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#grounding-always-on).

`bossku install --profile full` installs and lists the entire library (~240 skills), including all other vendored packs.

## Vendored packs

| scroll-world | Scroll-scrub Higgsfield cinematic world landing | Higgsfield CLI, ffmpeg |
| dcg | Destructive Command Guard (agent shell/git safety hooks) | `dcg` binary (upstream installer) |
| emil-skills | 12 motion craft / design engineering skills (web + Expo animation, Sonner, Swift) | — |
| i-have-adhd | Action-first, numbered, no-preamble output shape (explicit `/i-have-adhd`) | — |

`bosskuai-headroom` routes context-compression work but does not install or configure the optional Headroom runtime. Use it only for bulky tool output; normal concise answers belong to `bosskuai-token-saver`.

|---|---|---|
| `bosskuai-taste` | `hallmark` | New UI pages that need a distinct non-template look |
| `bosskuai-taste` | `taste-skill` (default), `soft-skill`, `minimalist-skill`, `brutalist-skill`, `redesign-skill` | Full tasteskill.dev pack: dials, redesign audit, direction variants |

| `bosskuai-gsap-animation`, `bosskuai-lenis-smooth-scroll` | `scroll-world` | Higgsfield scroll-scrub fly-through world landing; use Bossku GSAP/Lenis for code-only motion |
| `bosskuai-taste`, `taste-skill`, `hallmark` | `emil-design-eng`, `animate`, `apple-design` | Motion craft (easing, duration, interruption, gesture); keep taste/hallmark for layout, type, color, content |
| `bosskuai-throwaway-prototype`, `bosskuai-rapid-prototype` | `prototype` | `/prototype` is user-invoked; the model-run path for UI variants is `bosskuai-throwaway-prototype` (its UI.md builds switchable variants); `bosskuai-rapid-prototype` for MVP scaffolds |
| `bosskuai-expo-react-native` | `animate-expo` | Motion, gestures, sheets, haptics in Expo; keep the Bossku skill for app structure, EAS, and release |
| `antislop-copywriting`, `bosskuai-token-saver` | `i-have-adhd` | Reader asked for action-first output; it is an explicit mode that persists until "stop adhd mode" |
| `bosskuai-database-engineering` | `mysql-patterns`, `database-migrations` | MySQL/MariaDB specifics (InnoDB, replica lag) or a zero-downtime migration plan |

| `bosskuai-grounding` | `bosskuai-deep-research`, `odl-pdf` | Always-on grounding discipline; add deep-research for multi-source synthesis, odl-pdf for citation-ready PDF extraction |
| `markitdown` | `odl-pdf` | OpenDataLoader-specific or structured PDF work: scanned OCR, tables, JSON, bounding boxes, or citation-ready RAG; keep `markitdown` for generic Office/PDF/HTML-to-Markdown conversion |
